<p>The Editor of this little Collection ventures to think it may in
some measure supply a want which he has heard mentioned, not only in
the Principality, but in England also.&nbsp; Some of the Editor&rsquo;s
English friends&mdash;themselves being eminent in literature&mdash;have
said to him, &ldquo;We have often heard that there is much of value
in your literature and of beauty in your poetry.&nbsp; Why does not
some one of your literati translate them into English, and furnish us
with the means of judging for ourselves?&nbsp; We possess translated
specimens of the literature, and especially the poetry of almost every
other nation and people, and should feel greater interest in reading
those of the aborigines of this country, with whom we have so much in
common.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to gratify this wish that the Editor was
induced to give his services in the present undertaking, from which
he has received and will receive no pecuniary benefit; and his sole
recompense will be the satisfaction of having attempted to extend and
perpetuate some of the treasures and beauties of the literature of his
native country.</p>
<h2><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>The literature of a people always reflects their character.&nbsp;
You may discover in the prose and poetry of a nation its social condition,
and in their different phases its political progress.&nbsp; The age
of Homer was the heroic, in which the Greeks excelled in martial exploits;
that of Virgil found the Romans an intellectual and gallant race; the
genius of Chaucer, Spencer and Sidney revelled in the feudal halls and
enchanted vistas of the middle ages; Shakespeare delineated the British
mind in its grave and comic moods; Milton reflected the sober aspect
and spiritual aspirations of the Puritanical era; while at later periods
Pope, Goldsmith and Cowper pourtrayed the softer features of an advanced
civilization and milder times.</p>
<p>Following the same rule, the history of Wales is its literature.&nbsp;
First came the odes and triads, in which the bards recited the valour,
conquests and hospitality of their chieftains, and the gentleness, beauty
and virtue of their brides.&nbsp; This was the age of Aneurin, of Taliesin
and Llywarch Hen.&nbsp; Next came the period of love and romance, wherein
were celebrated the refined courtship and gay bridals of gallant knights
and lovely maids.&nbsp; <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>This
was the age of Dafydd ap Gwilym, of Hywel ap Einion and Rhys Goch.&nbsp;
In later times appeared the moral songs and religious hymns of the Welsh
Puritans, wherein was conspicuous above all others William Williams
of Pantycelyn, aptly denominated &ldquo;The Sweet Psalmist of Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Principality, like every other country, has had and has its orators,
its philosophers and historians; and, much as they are prized by its
native race, we venture to predict that the productions of none will
outlive the language in which their prose is spoken and writ.&nbsp;
Not that there is wanting either eloquence or grandeur or force in their
orations and essays, depth or originality in their philosophical theories,
or truthfulness, research or learning in their historic lore; but that
neither the graces of the first, the novelty of the next, or the fidelity
of the last will in our opinion justify a translation into more widely
spoken tongues, and be read with profit and interest by a people whose
libraries are filled with all that is most charming in literature, most
profound in philosophy and most new and advanced in science and art.</p>
<p>Our evil prophecy of its prose does not however extend to the poetry
of Wales, for like all other branches of the Celtic race, the ancient
Britons have cultivated national song and music with a love, skill and
devotion which have produced poems and airs well deserving of extensive
circulation, long life and lasting fame.&nbsp; The poetic fire has inspired
the nation from the most primitive times, for we find that an order
of the Druidical priests were bards who composed their metres among
aboriginal temples and <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>spreading
groves of oak.&nbsp; The bard was an important member of the royal household,
for the court was not complete without the Bard President, the Chief
of Song, and the Domestic Bard.&nbsp; The laws of Hywel the Good, King
or Prince of Wales in the tenth century, enact:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If there should be fighting, the bard shall sing
&lsquo;The Monarchy of Britain&rsquo; in front of the battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bard President shall sit at the Royal Table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a bard shall ask a gift of a prince, let him sing one
piece; when he asks of a baron, let him sing three pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His land shall be free, and he shall have a horse in attendance
from the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief of Song shall begin the singing in the common hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall be next but one to the patron of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall have a harp from the king, and a gold ring from the
queen when his office is secured to him.&nbsp; The harp he shall never
part with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a song is called for, the Bard President should begin;
the first song shall be addressed to God, the next to the king.&nbsp;
The Domestic Bard shall sing to the queen and royal household.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bard therefore in ancient times performed important functions.&nbsp;
In peace he delighted his lord with songs of chivalry, love and friendship.&nbsp;
In war he accompanied his prince to battle, and recited the might and
prowess of his leader and the martial virtue of his hosts.&nbsp; No
court or hall was complete without the presence of the bard, who enlivened
the feast with his minstrelsy and song.&nbsp; We also see that the Welsh
bard, like the primitive poets of Greece, and the troubadours of southern
France, sang his verses to the harp, whose dulcet strings have always
sent forth the national melodies.&nbsp; The chief bards were attached
to the courts and castles of their princes and chieftains; <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>but
a multitude of inferior minstrels wandered the country singing to their
harps, and were in those primitive times received with open arms and
welcome hospitality in the houses of the gentry, and whither soever
they went.&nbsp; Even within living memory the English tourist has often
met in the lonely dells and among the mountain passes of Wales the wayworn
minstrel, with harp strung to his shoulders, ever ready to delight the
traveller with the bewitching notes of his lyre and song.&nbsp; But
the modern bard of Wales is the counterpart of his Scottish brother,
of whom Scott wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The way was long, the wind was cold,<br />
The minstrel was infirm and old;<br />
His withered cheeks and tresses gray<br />
Seemed to have known a better day;<br />
The harp, his sole remaining joy,<br />
Was carried by an orphan boy.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>No more on prancing palfry borne,<br />
He carolled light as lark at morn;<br />
No longer courted and caress&rsquo;d,<br />
High placed in hall, a welcome guest,<br />
He poured to lord and lady gay<br />
The unpremeditated lay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor will the modern visitor to the castles and halls of the Principality,
not to mention its principal hotels, often miss the dulcet strains of
the national lyre.</p>
<p>The song and minstrelsy of Wales have from the earliest period of
its history been nurtured by its eisteddfodau.&nbsp; It is ascertained
that the Prince Bleddyn ap Kynfyn held an eisteddfod in A.D. 1070, which
was attended by the bards and chief literati of the time.&nbsp; This
eisteddfod made rules <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>for
the better government of the bardic order.&nbsp; This annual assemblage
of princes, bards and literati has been regularly held through the intervening
centuries to the present time.&nbsp; Within living memory royalty has
graced this national gathering of the ancient British race.</p>
<p>The ceremonies attendant upon this national institution are well
known.&nbsp; The president or chief, followed by the various grades
of the bardic order, walk in procession (<i>gorymdaith</i>) to the place
appointed, where twelve stones are laid in a circle, with one in the
centre, to form a <i>gorsedd</i> or throne.&nbsp; When the whole order
is assembled, the chief of bards ascends the <i>gorsedd</i>, and from
his laurel and flower-bedecked chair opens the session, by repeating
aloud the mottoes of the order, viz.: &ldquo;<i>Y gwir yn erbyn y byd</i>,
<i>yn ngwyneb haul a llygad goleuni</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The truth
against the world, in the face of the sun and the eye of light,&rdquo;
meaning that the proceedings, judgments and awards of the order are
guided by unswerving truth, and conducted in an open forum beneath the
eyes of the public.&nbsp; Then follow verses laudatory of the president.&nbsp;
Poetical compositions, some of a very high order, are then rehearsed
or read, interspersed with singing and lyric music.&nbsp; The greater
part of the poets and musical performers compete for prizes on given
subjects, which are announced beforehand on large placards throughout
the Principality.&nbsp; The subjects for competition are for the most
part patriotic, but religion and loyalty are supreme throughout the
eisteddfod.&nbsp; The successful competitors are crowned or decorated
by the fair hands of lady patronesses, who distribute the prizes.&nbsp;
This yearly gathering of the rank, beauty, wealth <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and
talent of the Principality, to commemorate their nationality and foster
native genius, edified and delighted by the gems of Welsh oratory, music
and song, cannot but be a laudable institution as well as pleasant recreation.&nbsp;
Some of the foremost English journals, who devote columns of their best
narrative talent to record a horse race, a Scottish highland wrestle,
or hideous prize fight with all their accompaniments of vice and brutality,
may surely well spare the ridicule and contempt with which they visit
the pleasant Welsh eisteddfod.&nbsp; Their shafts, howsoever they may
irritate for the time, ought surely not to lower the Welshman&rsquo;s
estimate of his eisteddfod, seeing the antiquity of its origin, the
praiseworthiness of its objects, the good it has done, the talent it
has developed,&mdash;as witness, a Brinley Richards and Edith Wynne,&mdash;and
the delight it affords to his country people.&nbsp; Enveloped in the
panoply of patriotism, truth and goodness, he may well defy the harmless
darts of angry criticism and invective, emanating from writers who are
foreign in blood, language, sympathy and taste.&nbsp; When the Greeks
delighted in their olympic games of running for a laurel crown, the
Romans witnessed with savage pleasure the deadly contentions of their
gladiators, the Spaniards gazed with joy on their bloody bull fights,
and the English crowded to look at the horse race or prize fight, the
Cymry met peaceably in the recesses of their beautiful valleys and mountains
to rehearse the praises of religion and virtue, to sing the merits of
beauty, truth and goodness, and all heightened by the melodious strains
of their national lyre.</p>
<p>It is often asked, what is poetry?&nbsp; Prose, we assume to be a
simple or connected narrative of ordinary facts or <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>common
circumstances.&nbsp; Poetry, on the other hand, is a grouping of great,
grand or beautiful objects in nature, or of fierce, fine or lofty passions,
or beautiful sentiments, or pretty ideas of the human heart or mind,
and all these premises expressed in suitable or becoming language.&nbsp;
Poetry is most indulged in the infancy of society when nature is a sealed
book, and the uneducated mind fills creation with all sorts of beings
and phantoms.&nbsp; There is then wide scope for the rude imagination
to wander at will through the unknown universe, and to people it with
every description of mythical beings and superstitious objects.&nbsp;
Poetry is most powerful in the infancy of civilization, and enjoys a
license of idea and language which would shock the taste of more advanced
times.&nbsp; The Hindustani poetry as furnished by Sir William Jones,
that of the Persian Hafiz, the early ballads of the Arabians, Moors
and Spaniards, the poems of Ossian, besides the primitive Saxon ballads,
and the triads of Wales, all indicate the extravagant imagery and rude
license of poetry in the early ages of society.&nbsp; The history of
those several nations also attests the magical influence of their early
poetry upon the peoples.&nbsp; We find that Tallifer the Norman trouvere,
who accompanied William to the invasion of England, went before his
hosts at Hastings, reciting the Norman prowess and might, and flung
himself upon the Saxon phalanx where he met his doom.&nbsp; We read
that the example of the trouvere aroused the Norman hosts to an enthusiasm
which precipitated them upon the Saxon ranks with unwonted courage and
frenzy.&nbsp; We also find that the Welsh bard always accompanied his
prince to battle, and rehearsed in song the ancient valour and conquests
of the chieftain and army in front of the enemy.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The
progress of philosophy and science dissipates the myths and spectres
of the poetical creation, just as the advance of a July sun dispels
the mist and cloud which hung over the earlier hours of day and veiled
the mountains and valleys from the eye of man.&nbsp; Poetry becomes
now shorn of its greatest extravangancies and wildest flights, instead
of soaring with the eagle to the extremities of space, it flies like
the falcon within human sight.&nbsp; In lieu of a Homer, a Shakespeare
and a Milton, we have a Pope, a Thomson and a Campbell.</p>
<p>The poetry of Wales may be classified into six parts, viz.: the sublime,
the beautiful, the patriotic, the humourous, the sentimental and religious.&nbsp;
Much of the poetry of the Principality consists of the first class,
and is specially dedicated to description and praise of the Supreme
Being, the universe and man.&nbsp; As the great objects of creation,
like the sun and moon, the planetary world and stars first attract the
attention of man and always enlist his deepest feelings, so they furnish
the great themes for the poetry of all nations, more especially in its
ruder stages.&nbsp; The Welsh poet is no exception to the rule.&nbsp;
On the contrary, he indulges in the highest flights of imagination,
and borrows the grandest imagery and choicest description to set forth
the Most High and his wonderful works.&nbsp; No translation can convey
to the English reader the interest and effect which this class of poetry
has and produces upon the Welsh mind, simply because their trains of
thought are so entirely different.&nbsp; The power and expressiveness
of the Welsh language, which cannot be transferred into any English
words, also add materially to the effect of this class of poetry upon
the native mind.&nbsp; The Cymric is <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>unquestionably
an original language, and possesses a force and expression entirely
unknown to any of the derivative tongues.&nbsp; The finer parts of scripture,
as the Book of Job and the Psalms, are immeasurably more impressive
in the Welsh than English language.&nbsp; The native of the Principality,
who from a long residence in the metropolis or other parts of England,
and extensive acquaintance with its people, followed often by mercantile
success, so as almost to become Anglicised, no sooner returns to his
native hills, either for a visit or residence, and upon the Sabbath
morn enters the old parish church or chapel to hear the bible read in
the native tongue, than he feels a transport of delight and joy, to
which his heart has been foreign since he crossed the border, mayhap
in youth.&nbsp; Much of this may be owing to a cause similar to that
which fires the Swiss soldier on foreign service when he hears the chant
of his own mountain &ldquo;<i>Rans des vaches</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Something
may doubtless be laid to the account of early association; but, we think,
more is justly due to the great impressiveness and power of his native
tongue.&nbsp; The poems, original and translated, contained in the first
part of the ensuing collection, may convey to the English reader some
idea of this class of Welsh poetry.</p>
<p>The love of the beautiful is natural to man, but of all nations the
Greeks entertained the best ideals and cultivated the faculty to the
highest perfection.&nbsp; Their temples have formed models of architectural
beauty for all nations, and the grace and elegance of their statuary
have found students among every people.&nbsp; Much of this taste for
the beautiful mingled with their poetry, which is kin sister to the
imitative arts.&nbsp; In recent times the Italians have inherited <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the
faculty of beauty, and introduced it into their fine cathedrals and
capitols, as well as their statuary.&nbsp; The French also have displayed
the highest ideals of beauty in their manufactures and fine arts.&nbsp;
The Spaniards have introduced into their poetry some of the inimitable
grace and beauty of their Alhambra.&nbsp; The Latin races appear in
modern times to have been pre-distinguished in the fine arts.&nbsp;
Much of the taste for beauty is inherent in the Celtic races, and this
element is very perceptible in the poetry of the Cymric branch, as will
appear from the illustrations contained in the second part of this collection.</p>
<p>Patriotism, or love of country, is characteristic of all nations,
and manifests itself in their poetical effusions, more especially of
the earlier date.&nbsp; It is but natural that man should feel a profound
attachment to the land of his fathers, to the valley where he spent
the early and happier years of his life, to the hills which bounded
that plain, to the church or chapel where he worshipped in youth, and
in whose cemetery rest the ashes of his kin, to the language of his
childhood, its literature, history and traditions, and more especially
to the kind family, neighbours and friends who watched over his infancy,
and entertained his maturer years.&nbsp; This attachment, which is no
other than patriotism, is only deepened by his removal into a distant
land, and among a strange people.&nbsp; Perhaps no people in modern
times have cultivated their patriotic songs more ardently or even more
successfully than the Scotch; though probably most of this may be owing
to their great minstrel Scott, who transformed their rude ballads into
immortal song.&nbsp; Moore did a similar, though smaller, service <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>for
the Irish branch of the Celtic race.&nbsp; And we most truly think that
a Welsh Scott or Moore is only wanting to marry the lays of Wales to
undying verse.&nbsp; The third part of this collection will contain
some of the most spirited of the patriotic poems of Wales.</p>
<p>Humour is inherent in every people, and is more or less characteristic
of every nation.&nbsp; Cervantes among the Spaniards, the Abbate Casti
among the Italians, Jean Paul Richter among the Germans, Voltaire among
the French, Samuel Butler, the author of Hudibras, and Dr. John Wolcot
among the English, Jonathan Swift among the Irish, and Robert Burns
among the Scotch, have introduced humorous writing into the literature
of their respective countries with more or less of success.&nbsp; Nor
was it possible that a people so lively, so susceptible of contrast,
and possessed of so keen a sense of the ridiculous in manners and conversation
as the Welsh, should not spice their literature with examples of humorous
writing.&nbsp; We shall furnish in the fourth part of this collection
a few specimens from the writings of some of the humorists of Wales.</p>
<p>Sentiment, which may be defined as the emotion of the human heart,
mixes freely in verse and sentimental poetry, forms a considerable portion
of the lays of every country.&nbsp; There is in this particular no distinction
between the early and modern history of nations, for sentiment enters
the metrical effusions of every period alike.&nbsp; Pathos and taste
appear to be the foster mothers of this quality, which is a distinguishing
trait of the poetry of Wales, as shown by the examples furnished in
the fifth part of this collection.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>If
any trait be more distinctive of the Welshman than another, it is his
love for his bible, his chapel and church, and this has furnished the
richest store of spiritual song.&nbsp; The hymnists of Wales are many;
but distinguished beyond and above every other, is the celebrated Williams
of Pantycelyn, whose hymns are sung in every chapel and cottage throughout
the Principality, and are now as refreshing to the religious tastes
and emotions of the people as at their first appearance; and, from their
intrinsic beauty and warmth, they are not likely to be lost so long
as the Welsh language remains a spoken or written tongue.&nbsp; The
sixth part of this collection will furnish the reader with an insight
into the transcendent merit and fervour of this prince of religious
song.</p>
<h2><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>PART
I.&nbsp; THE SUBLIME.</h2>
<h3>SNOWDON.</h3>
<p>King of the mighty hills! thy crown of snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou rearest in the clouds, as if to mock<br />
The littleness of human things below;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tempest cannot harm thee, and the shock<br />
Of the deep thunder falls upon thy head<br />
As the light footfalls of an infant&rsquo;s tread.</p>
<p>The livid lightning&rsquo;s all destroying flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has flashed upon thee harmlessly, the rage<br />
Of savage storms have left thee still the same;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art imperishable!&nbsp; Age after age<br />
Thou hast endured; aye, and for evermore<br />
Thy form shall be as changeless as before.</p>
<p>The works of man shall perish and decay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cities shall crumble down to dust, and all<br />
Their &ldquo;gorgeous palaces&rdquo; shall pass away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even their lofty monuments shall fall;<br />
And a few scattered stones be all to tell<br />
The place where once they stood,&mdash;where since they fell!</p>
<p>Yet, even time has not the power to shiver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One single fragment from thee; thou shalt be<br />
A monument that shall exist for ever!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the vast world endures in its immensity,<br />
The eternal snows that gather on thy brow<br />
Shall diadem thy crest, as they do now.</p>
<p>Thy head is wrapt in mists, yet still thou gleam&rsquo;st,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At intervals, from out the clouds, that are<br />
A glorious canopy, in which thou seem&rsquo;st<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To shroud thy many beauties; now afar<br />
Thou glitterest in the sun, and dost unfold<br />
Thy giant form, in robes of burning gold.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>And,
when the red day dawned upon thee, oh! how bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy mighty form appeared! a thousand dies<br />
Shed o&rsquo;er thee all the brilliance of their light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Catching their hues from the o&rsquo;er-arching skies,<br />
That seemed to play around thee, like a dress<br />
Sporting around some form of loveliness.</p>
<p>And when the silver moonbeams on thee threw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their calm and tranquil light, thou seem&rsquo;st to be<br />
A thing so wildly beautiful to view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wrapt in strange unearthly mystery,<br />
That the mind feels an awful sense of fear<br />
When gazing on thy form, so wild and drear.</p>
<p>The poet loves to gaze upon thee when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No living soul is near, and all are gone<br />
Wooing their couches for soft sleep; for then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet feels that he is <i>least</i> alone,&mdash;<br />
Holding communion with the mighty dead,<br />
Whose viewless shadows flit around thy head.</p>
<p>Say, does the spirit of some warrior bard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With unseen form, float on the misty air,<br />
As if intent thy sacred heights to guard?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does he breathe his mournful murmurs there,<br />
As if returned to earth, once more to dwell<br />
On the dear spot he ever lov&rsquo;d so well.</p>
<p>Perhaps some Druid form, in awful guise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With words of wond&rsquo;rous import, there may range,<br />
Making aloud mysterious sacrifice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With gestures incommunicably strange,<br />
Praying to the gods he worshipped, to restore<br />
His dear lov&rsquo;d Cymru to her days of yore.</p>
<p>Or does thy harp, oh, Hoel! sound its strings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With chords of fire proclaim thy country&rsquo;s praise;<br />
And he of &ldquo;Flowing Song&rsquo;s&rdquo; wild murmurings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe forth the music of his warrior lays;<br />
And Davydd, Caradoc&mdash;a glorious band&mdash;<br />
Tune their wild harps to praise their mountain land?</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Thou
stand&rsquo;st immovable, and firmly fixed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Cambria&rsquo;s sons in battle, when they met<br />
The Roman legions, and their weapons mixed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clash&rsquo;d as bravely as they can do yet.<br />
The Saxon, Dane, and Norman, knew them well,<br />
And found them&mdash;as they are&mdash;invincible!</p>
<p>Majestic Snowdon! proudly dost thou stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a tall giant ready for the fray,<br />
The guardian bulwark of thy mountain land;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old as the world thou art!&nbsp; As I survey<br />
Thy lofty altitude, strange feelings rise,<br />
Of the unutterable mind&rsquo;s wild sympathies.</p>
<p>Thou hast seen many changes, yet hast stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unaltered to the last, remained the same<br />
Even in the wildness of thy solitude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in thy savage grandeur; and thy name<br />
Acts as a spell on Cambria&rsquo;s sons, that brings<br />
Their heart&rsquo;s best blood to flow in rapid springs.</p>
<p>And must I be the only one to sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy dear loved name? and must the task be mine,<br />
To the insensate mind thy name to bring?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! how I grieve to think, when songs divine<br />
Have echoed to thy praises night and day,<br />
I can but offer thee so poor a lay.</p>

DAY OF JUDGMENT.</h3>

<p>[This poet, who was born in 1722, obtained great celebrity in Wales;
he was a native of Anglesea, and entered the Welsh Church, but removed
to Donington in Shropshire, where he officiated as Curate for several
years.&nbsp; There the following poem was composed and afterwards translated
by the poet.&nbsp; The poem has been copied from a MS of the poet, and
is now, it is believed, published for the first time.]</p>
<p>Almighty God thy heavenly aid bestow,<br />
O&rsquo;er my rapt soul bid inspiration flow;<br />
Let voice seraphic, mighty Lord, be mine,<br />
Whilst I unfold this awful bold design.<br />
No less a theme my lab&rsquo;ring breast inspires,<br />
Than earth&rsquo;s last throes and overwhelming fires,<br />
Than man arising from his dark abode<br />
To meet the final sentence of his God!<br />
The voice of ages, yea of every clime,<br />
The hoary records of primeval time;<br />
The saints of Christ in glowing words display,<br />
The dread appearance of that fateful day!<br />
Oh! may the world for that great day prepare<br />
With ceaseless diligence and solemn care,<br />
No human wisdom knows, no human power<br />
Can tell the coming of that fatal hour.<br />
No warning sign shall point out nature&rsquo;s doom;<br />
Resistless, noiseless it shall surely come,<br />
Like a fierce giant rushing to the fight,<br />
Or silent robber in the shades of night.<br />
What heart unblenched can dare to meet this day,<br />
A day of darkness and of dire dismay?<br />
What sinner&rsquo;s eye can fearless then&mdash;behold<br />
The day of horrors on his sight unfold,<br />
But to the good a day of glorious light,<br />
A day for chasing all the glooms of night.<br />
For then shall burst on man&rsquo;s astonished eyes<br />
The Christian banner waving in the skies,<br />
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Borne
by angelic bands supremely fair,<br />
By countless seraphs through the pathless air.<br />
The heavenly sky shall Christ&rsquo;s proud banner form,<br />
A sky unruffled by a cloud or storm;<br />
The bloody cross aloft in awful pride<br />
Shall float triumphant o&rsquo;er the airy tide.<br />
Then shall the King with splendour cloth&rsquo;d on high<br />
Ride through the glories of the golden sky,<br />
With power resistless guide his awful course,<br />
And curb the whirlwinds in their wildest force.<br />
The white robed angels shall resound the praise,<br />
Ten thousand saints their choral songs shall raise<br />
Now through the void a louder shout shall roar<br />
Than surges dashing on a rocky shore.<br />
An awful silence reigns!&mdash;the angels sound<br />
The final sentence to the worlds around;<br />
Loud through the heavens the echoing blast shall roll,<br />
And nature, startled, shake from Pole to Pole.<br />
All flesh shall tremble at the fearful sign,<br />
And dread to approach the judgment seat divine;<br />
The loftiest hills, which &rsquo;mid the tempest reign,<br />
Shall sink and totter, levelled with the plain.<br />
The hideous din of rushing torrents far<br />
Augment the horrors of this final war;<br />
The glorious sun, the gorgeous eye of day,<br />
Shall faint and sicken in this vast decay.<br />
From our struck view his golden beams shall hide,<br />
As when the Saviour on Calvaria died;<br />
The lovely moon no more in beauty gleam,<br />
Or tinge the ocean with her silv&rsquo;ry beam;<br />
Ten thousand stars shall from their orbits roll,<br />
In dread confusion through the empty pole.<br />
At the loud blasts hell&rsquo;s barriers fall around,<br />
Even Satan trembles at the awful sound!<br />
Far down he sinks, deep in the realms of night,<br />
And strives to shun the glorious Son of Light.<br />
&ldquo;Rise from your tomb,&rdquo; the mighty angel cries,<br />
&ldquo;Ye sleeping mortals, and approach the skies,<br />
For Christ is thron&rsquo;d upon his Judgment Seat,<br />
And for his mercy may ye all be meet!&rdquo;<br />
The roaring ocean from its inmost caves<br />
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Shall
send forth thousands o&rsquo;er the foaming waves;<br />
From earth the countless myriads shall arise,<br />
Like corn-land springing &rsquo;neath benignant skies;<br />
For all must then appear&mdash;we all shall meet<br />
In dread array before Christ&rsquo;s Judgment Seat!<br />
All flesh shall stand full in its Maker&rsquo;s view&mdash;<br />
The past, the present, and the future too;<br />
Not one shall fail, for rise with one accord<br />
Shall saint and sinner, vassal and his lord.<br />
Then Mary&rsquo;s Son, in heavenly pomp&rsquo;s array,<br />
Shall all his glory to the world display;<br />
The faithful twelve with saintly vesture graced,<br />
Friends of his cross around his throne are placed;<br />
The impartial judge the book of fate shall scan,<br />
The unerring records of the deeds of man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is opened! mark the anxious fear<br />
That calls the sigh and starts the bitter tear;<br />
The good shall hear a blessed sentence read,<br />
All mourning passes&mdash;all their griefs are fled.<br />
No more their souls with racking pains are riven,<br />
Their Lord admits them to the peace of heaven;<br />
The sinner there, with guilty crime oppressed,<br />
Bears on his brow the fears of hell confess&rsquo;d.<br />
Behold him now&mdash;his guilty looks&mdash;I see<br />
His God condemns, and mercy&rsquo;s God is He;<br />
No joy for him, for him no heaven appears<br />
To bid him welcome from a vale of tears.<br />
Hark!&nbsp; Jesu&rsquo;s voice with awful terrors swell,<br />
It shakes even heaven, it shakes the nether hell:<br />
&ldquo;Away ye cursed from my sight, retire<br />
Down to the depths of hell&rsquo;s eternal fire,<br />
Down to the realms of endless pain and night,<br />
Ye fiends accursed, from my angry sight<br />
Depart! for heaven with saintly inmates pure<br />
No crime can harbour or can sin endure,<br />
Away! away where fiends infernal dwell,<br />
Down to your home and taste the pains of hell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold his servants&mdash;Lo, the virtuous bands<br />
Await the sentence which the life demands;<br />
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>All
blameless they their course in virtue run<br />
Have for their brows a crown of glory won.<br />
Their Saviour&rsquo;s voice, a sound of heavenly love,<br />
Admits them smiling to the realms above:<br />
&ldquo;Approach, ye faithful, to the heaven of peace,<br />
Where worldly sorrows shall for ever cease.<br />
Come, blessed children, share my bright abode,<br />
Rest in the bosom of your King and God,<br />
Where thousand saints in grateful concert sing<br />
Loud hymns of glory to th&rsquo; Eternal King.&rdquo;<br />
For you, beloved, I hung upon the tree,<br />
That where I am there also ye might be;<br />
The infernal god (ye trembling sinners quake)<br />
Shall hurl you headlong on the burning lake,<br />
There shall ye die, nor dying shall expire,<br />
Rolled on the waves of everlasting fire,<br />
Whilst Christ shall bid his own lov&rsquo;d flock rejoice,<br />
And lead them upward with approving voice,<br />
Where countless hosts their heavenly Lord obey,<br />
And sing Hosannas in the courts of day.<br />
O gracious God! each trembling suppliant spare&mdash;<br />
Grant each the glory of that song to share;<br />
May Christ, my God, a kind physician be,<br />
And may He grant me bless&rsquo;d Eternity!</p>
<h3>THE IMMOVABLE COVENANT.</h3>
<p>[The Reverend David Lewis Pughe, who translated the following piece
from the Welsh of Mr. H. Hughes, was a Minister in the Baptist Church,
and was possessed of extensive learning, and a highly critical taste.&nbsp;
After officiating as Minister at a Church in Swansea and other places,
he finally settled at Builth, where he died at an early age.]</p>
<p>Ye cloud piercing mountains so mighty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose age is the age of the sky;<br />
No cold blasts of winter affright ye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor heats of the summer defy:<br />
You&rsquo;ve witness&rsquo;d the world&rsquo;s generations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Succeeding like waves on the sea;<br />
The deluge you saw, when doom&rsquo;d nations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain to your summits would flee.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>You
challenge the pyramids lasting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That rolling milleniums survive;<br />
Fierce whirlwinds, and thunderbolts blasting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And oceans with tempests alive!<br />
But lo! there&rsquo;s a day fast approaching,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shall your foundations reveal,&mdash;<br />
The powers of heaven will be shaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And earth like a drunkard shall reel!</p>
<p>Proud Idris, and Snowdon so tow&rsquo;ring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye now will be skipping like lambs;<br />
The Alps will, by force overpow&rsquo;ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Propell&rsquo;d be disporting like rams!<br />
The breath of Jehovah will hurl you&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloft in the air you shall leap:<br />
Your crash, like his thunder&rsquo;s who&rsquo;ll whirl you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall blend with the roars of the deep.</p>
<p>All ties, and strong-holds, with their powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall, water-like, melting be found;<br />
Earth&rsquo;s palaces, temples, and towers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall then be all dash&rsquo;d to the ground:<br />
But were this great globe plunged for ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In seas of oblivion, or prove<br />
Untrue to its orbit, yet never,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My God, will thy covenant move!</p>
<p>The skies, as if kindling with ire and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resentment, will pour on this ball<br />
A deluge of sulphurous fire, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Consume its doom&rsquo;d elements all!<br />
But though heaven and earth will be passing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away on time&rsquo;s Saturday eve;<br />
The covenant-bonds, notwithstanding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are steadfast to all that believe!</p>
<p>I see&mdash;but no longer deriding&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sinner with gloom on his brow:<br />
He cries to the mountains to hide him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But nothing can shelter him now!<br />

raves&mdash;all but demons reject him!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not so the Christian so pure;<br />
The covenant-arms will protect him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In these he&rsquo;ll be ever secure!</p>
<p>Thus fixed, while his triumphs unfolding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enrapture his bosom serene:<br />
In sackcloth the heavens he&rsquo;s beholding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nature dissolving is seen;<br />
He mounts to the summits of glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And joins with the harpers above,<br />
Whose theme is sweet Calvary&rsquo;s story&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of covenant love.</p>
<p>Methinks, after ages unnumber&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have roll&rsquo;d in eternity&rsquo;s flight,<br />
I see him, by myriads surrounded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enrob&rsquo;d in the garments of light;<br />
And shouting o&rsquo;er this world&rsquo;s cold ashes&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy covenant, my God, still remains:<br />
No tittle or jot away passes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus it my glory sustains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks, as around him he glances,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye sov&rsquo;reigns and princes so gay,<br />
Where are your engagements and pledges?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are they&mdash;where are they to-day?<br />
Where are all the covenants sacred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That mortal with mortals e&rsquo;er made?&rdquo;<br />
A silent voice whispers,&mdash;&ldquo;Departed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis long since their records did fade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hear him again, while he&rsquo;s winging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His flight through the realms of the sky,<br />
Th&rsquo; immovable covenant singing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With voice so melodious and high<br />
That all the bright mountains celestial<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are dancing, as thrill&rsquo;d with delight:<br />
Too lofty for visions terrestial&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He vanishes now from my sight.</p>

Thou fountain of love everlasting&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High home of the purpose to save:<br />

<h3>AN ODE TO THE THUNDER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Translated by the Rev. R. Harries Jones, M.A</span>.</p>
<p>[The author of the following poem, Mr. David Richards, better known
by his bardic name of Dafydd Ionawr, was born in the year 1751 at Glanmorfa,
near Towyn, Merionethshire, and died in 1827.&nbsp; He was educated
at Ystradmeurig Grammar School, with a view to entering the Welsh Church,
but his academic career was cut short by the death of his parents, and
he devoted himself to tuition.&nbsp; He composed two long poems, viz.:
an &ldquo;Ode to the Trinity,&rdquo; and an &ldquo;Ode to the Deluge,&rdquo;
besides a number of minor poems, and were first published in 1793.&nbsp;
This poet is designated the Welsh Milton, by reason of the grandeur
of his conceptions and the force of his expression.]</p>
<p>Swift-flying courser of the ambient skies!<br />
Thy trackless bourne no mortal ken espies!<br />
But in thy wake the swelling echoes roll<br />
While furious torrents pour from pole to pole;<br />
The thunder bellows forth its sullen roar<br />
Like seething ocean on the storm-lashed shore;<br />
The muttering heavens send terror through the vale,<br />
And awe-struck mountains shiver in the gale;<br />
An angry, sullen, overwhelming sound<br />
That shakes each craggy hollow round and round,<br />
And more astounding than the serried host<br />
Which all the world&rsquo;s artillery can boast;&mdash;<br />
And fiercely rushing from the lurid sky<br />
From pregnant clouds and murky canopy<br />
The deluge saturates both hill and plain&mdash;<br />
The maddened welkin groaning with the strain:<br />
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>The
torrents dash from upland moors along<br />
Their journey to the main, in endless throng,<br />
And restless, turbid rivers seethe and rack,<br />
Like foaming cataracts, their bounding track;<br />
A devastating flood sweeps o&rsquo;er the land,<br />
Tartarean darkness swathes the sable strand!<br />
O&rsquo;er wolds and hills, o&rsquo;er ocean&rsquo;s chafing waves<br />
The wild tornado&rsquo;s bluster wierdly raves;<br />
The white-heat bolt of every thundering roar<br />
The pitchy zenith coruscating o&rsquo;er;<br />
The vast expanse of heaven pours forth its ire<br />
&rsquo;Mid swarthy fogs streaked with candescent fire!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sombre meadows can be trod no more<br />
Nor beetling brow that over-laps the shore;<br />
The hailstones clattering thro&rsquo; field and wood&mdash;<br />
The rain, the lightning and the scouring flood,<br />
The dread of waters and the blazing sky<br />
Make pensive captives all humanity;<br />
Confusion reigns o&rsquo;er all the seething land,<br />
From mountain peak to ocean&rsquo;s clammy strand;<br />
As if&mdash;it seemed&mdash;but weak are human words,<br />
The rocks of Christendom were rent to sherds:<br />
They clash, they dash, they crash, above, around,<br />
The earth-quake, dread, splits up and rasps the ground!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, my muse, my goddess from above,<br />
Of dazzling sheen, and clothed in robes of love,<br />
What this wild rage&mdash;this cataclysmic fall&mdash;<br />
What rends the welkin, and, Who rules them all?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis God!&nbsp; The Blest!&nbsp; All elements
are his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who rules the unfathonable dark abyss.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis God commands!&nbsp; His edicts are their will!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be silent, heavens!&nbsp; The heavens are hushed and still!&rdquo;<br />
These are the wail of elemental life;<br />
The fire and water wage supernal strife;<br />
The blasting fire, with scathing, angry glare,<br />
Gleamed like an asphalte furnace in the air:<br />
Around, above it swirled the water&rsquo;s sweep,<br />
And plunged its scorching legions in the deep!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>The
works of God are good and infinite,<br />
The perfect offsprings of his love and might,<br />
And wonderful, beneficient in every land&mdash;<br />
With wisdom crowned the creatures of His hand;<br />
And truly, meekly, lowly must we bow<br />
To worship Him who made all things below,<br />
For from His holy, dazzling throne above<br />
He gives the word, commanding, yet in love,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye fogs of heaven, ye stagnant, sluggard forms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That float so laggardly amid the storms!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disperse!&nbsp; And hie you to yon dormant shores!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your black lair lies where ocean&rsquo;s caverns roar!&rdquo;<br />
The fogs of heaven o&rsquo;er yonder sun-tipped hill<br />
Their orcus-journey rush, and all is still.<br />
In brilliant brightness breaks the broad expanse<br />
Of firmament!&nbsp; Heaven opens to our glance;<br />
And day once more out-pours its silvery sheen,<br />
A couch pearl-decked, fit for its orient queen; (aurora)<br />
The sun beams brightly over hill and dale<br />
Its glancing rays enliven every vale:<br />
Its face effulgent makes the heaven to smile<br />
Thro&rsquo; dripping rain-drops yet it smiles the while,<br />
Its warmth makes loveable the teeming world,<br />
Hill, dale, where&rsquo;er its royal rays are hurled;<br />
Sweet nature smiles, and sways her magic wand,<br />
And sunshine gleams, beams, streams upon the strand;<br />
And warbling birds, like angels from above<br />
Do hum their hymns and sing their songs of love!&mdash;</p>

Black and fierce the firmament,<br />

A ray of light&rsquo;s not seen,<br />
But light&rsquo;ning white and flashy,<br />
Thunder throughout the heavens,<br />
A torrent from on high.<br />
A thousand cascades roar<br />
Boiling with floods of hate,<br />
Rivers all powerful<br />
With great commotion rush.<br />
The air disturb&rsquo;d is seen,<br />
While the distant sea&rsquo;s in uproar:<br />
The heaving ocean bounds,<br />
Within its prison wild;<br />
Great thundering throughout<br />
The bottomless abyss.<br />
Some folk, simple and bewilder&rsquo;d,<br />
For shelter seek the mountains;<br />
Shortly the raging waters<br />
Drown their loftiest summits.<br />
Where shall they go, where flee<br />
From the eternal torrent?<br />
Conscience, a ready witness,<br />

Mute among mortals,<br />

<p>Boiling and tearing was the fearful deep,<br />
Its raging waves aroused from lengthened sleep<br />

The swell how great&mdash;nature bursting its chains!<br />
The bounding spray dashed &rsquo;gainst the midnight stars<br />
In its wild flight shedding salt tears.</p>
<p>Again it came a sweeping mighty deluge,<br />
Washing the firmament with breakers huge;<br />
Ripping the ocean&rsquo;s bosom so madly,<br />
Wondrous its power when roaring so wildly,<br />

While all around threatened destruction wide.</p>

II.&nbsp; THE BEAUTIFUL.</h2>
<h3>AN ADDRESS TO THE SUMMER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Dafydd ap Gwilym</span>.</p>
<p>[Dafydd ap Gwilym was the son of Gwilym Gam, of Brogynin, in the
parish of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, and was born about the year
1340.&nbsp; The bard was of illustrious lineage, and of handsome person.&nbsp;
His poetical talent and personal beauty procured him the favourable
notice of the fair sex; which, however, occasioned him much misfortune.&nbsp;
His attachments were numerous, and one to Morvydd, the daughter of Madog
Lawgam, of Niwbwrch, in Anglesea, a Welsh chieftain, caused the bard
to be imprisoned.&nbsp; This lady was the subject of a great portion
of the bard&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; Dafydd ap Gwilym has been styled the
Petrarch of Wales.&nbsp; He composed some 260 poems, most of which are
sprightly, figurative, and pathetic.&nbsp; The late lamented Arthur
James Johnes, Esquire, translated the poems of Dafydd ap Gwilym into
English.&nbsp; They are very beautiful, and were published by Hooper,
Pall Mall, in 1834.&nbsp; The bard, after leading a desultory life,
died in or about the year 1400.]</p>
<p>Thou summer! so lovely and gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! whither so soon art thou gone?<br />
The world will attend to my lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While thy absence I sadly bemoan:<br />
With flow&rsquo;rs hast thou cherish&rsquo;d the glade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair orchard with opening buds,&mdash;<br />
The hedge-rows with darkening shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with verdure the meadows and woods.</p>
<p>How calm in the vale by the brook&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How blithe o&rsquo;er the lawn didst thou rove,<br />
To prepare the fresh bow&rsquo;r in the nook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the damsel whose wishes were love:<br />
When, smiling with heaven&rsquo;s bright beam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou didst paint every hillock and field,<br />
And reflect, in the smooth limpid stream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the elegance nature could yield.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Perfuming
the rose on the bush,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And arching the eglantine spray,<br />
Thou wast seen by the blackbird and thrush,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they chanted the rapturous lay:<br />
By yon river that bends o&rsquo;er the plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With alders and willows o&rsquo;erhung,<br />
Each warbler perceiv&rsquo;d the glad strain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And join&rsquo;d in the numerous song.</p>
<p>Here the nightingale perch&rsquo;d on the throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet and prince of the grove,<br />
Inviting the lingering morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taught the bard the sweet descant of love:<br />
And there, from the brake by the rill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When night&rsquo;s sober steps have retir&rsquo;d,<br />
Ten thousand gay choristers thrill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet confusion with rapture inspir&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Then the maiden, conducted by May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Persuasive adviser of love,<br />
With smiles that would rival the ray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nimbly trips to the bow&rsquo;r in the grove;<br />
Where sweetly I warble the song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which beauty&rsquo;s soft glances inspire;<br />
And, while melody flows from my tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul is enrapt with desire.</p>
<p>But how sadly revers&rsquo;d is the strain!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How doleful! since thou art away;<br />
Every copse, every hillock and plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has been mourning for many a day:<br />
My bow&rsquo;r, on the verge of the glade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where I sported in rapturous ease,<br />
Once the haunt of the delicate maid&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She forsakes it, and&mdash;how can it please?</p>
<p>Nor blame I the damsel who flies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When winter with threatening gale,<br />
Loudly howls through the dark frozen skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scatters the leaves o&rsquo;er the vale:<br />
<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>In
vain to the thicket I look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the birds that enchanted the fair,<br />
Or gaze on the wide-spreading oak;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No shelter, no music, is there.</p>
<p>But tempests, with hideous yell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chase the mist o&rsquo;er the brow of the hill,<br />
And grey torrents in every dell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deform the soft murmuring rill:<br />
And the hail, or the sleet, or the snow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On winter&rsquo;s hard mandate attends:<br />
To banishment, hence may they go&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s tyrants, and destiny&rsquo;s friend!</p>
<p>But thou, glorious summer, return,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And visit the destitute plains;<br />
Nor suffer thy poet to mourn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unheeded, in languishing strains:<br />
O! come on the wings of the breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And open the bloom of the thorn;<br />
Display thy green robe o&rsquo;er the trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all nature with beauty adorn.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Midst the bow&rsquo;rs of the fresh blooming May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the odours of violets float,<br />
Each bird, on his quivering spray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will remember his sprightliest note:<br />
Then the golden hair&rsquo;d lass, with a song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will deign to revisit the grove;<br />
Then, too, my harp shall be strung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To welcome the season of love.</p>

TO ARVON.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By the Rev. Evan Evans</span>.</p>
<p>[The poem from which the following translation is extracted was composed
by the Rev. Evan Evans, a Clergyman of the Church of England, better
known by his bardic name of <i>Ieuan Glan Geirionydd</i>.&nbsp; He was
born in 1795 at a freehold of his father, situate on the banks of the
river Geirionydd, in Carnarvonshire, and died in 1855.&nbsp; He composed
a great number of poems on different subjects, religious and patriotic,
several of which obtained prizes at Eisteddfodau, and one on the Resurrection
gained the chair or principal prize.&nbsp; This poet&rsquo;s compositions
are distinguished by great elegance, sweetness and pathos, and are much
esteemed in the Principality.&nbsp; Several of them have been set to
music.]</p>
<p>Where doth the cuckoo early sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In woodland, dell and valley?<br />
Where streamlets deep o&rsquo;er rocky cliffs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Form cataracts so lofty?<br />
On Snowdon&rsquo;s summits high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Arvon&rsquo;s pleasant county.</p>
<p>Flocks of thousand sheep are fed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon its mountains rugged,<br />
Her pastures green and meadows fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With cattle-herds are studded,<br />
Deep are the lakes in Arvon&rsquo;s vales<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where fish in shoals are landed.</p>
<p>The shepherd&rsquo;s soft and mellow voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is heard upon her mountain,<br />
Where oft he hums his rustic song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his beloved maiden,<br />
Resounding through the gorges deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With bleat of sheep and oxen.</p>
<p>On Arvon&rsquo;s rock-bound shore doth break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The surge in fretful murmur,<br />
And oft when stirr&rsquo;d by tempest high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ocean speaks in thunder,<br />

<p>The sun is glorious when it breaks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gloom of morning darkness,<br />
Sweet are the leaves and flowers of May<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Succeeding winter&rsquo;s baldness,<br />
Yet fairer than the whole to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are Arvon&rsquo;s maids so guile-less.</p>
<p>If to the sick there is delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To heal of his affliction,<br />
If to the traveller&rsquo;s weary sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet is the destination,<br />
Than all these sweeter far to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hills and dales of Arvon.</p>
<p>Had I the wings and speed of morn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To skim o&rsquo;er mount and valley,<br />
I&rsquo;d hie o&rsquo;er earth and sea direct<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Arvon&rsquo;s genial country,<br />
And there in peace would end my days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from deceit and envy.</p>
<h3>TO THE SPRING.</h3>
<p>Oh, come gentle spring, and visit the plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far scatter the frost from our border,<br />
All nature cries loud for the sunshine and rain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the howl of the winter is over.</p>
<p>Approach gentle spring, and show the white snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou cans&rsquo;t melt it by smiles and caresses,<br />
Chase far the cold winter away from us now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cover the fields with white daisies.</p>

<p>Oh, come gentle spring, breathe soft on the flowers,<br />

<p>[The Rev. John Blackwell, B.A., whose bardic name was <i>Alun</i>,
from the river of that name was born at Mold, in Flintshire, in the
year 1797, and died in 1840, in the parish of Manordeivi, Pembrokeshire,
of which he was Rector.&nbsp; He participated much in the Eisteddfodau
of that period, and his poems gained many of their prizes.&nbsp; He
also edited the &ldquo;Gwladgarwr,&rdquo; or the Patriot, a monthly
magazine, and afterwards the &ldquo;Cylchgrawn,&rdquo; or Circle of
Grapes, another magazine, under the auspices of the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.&nbsp; The subjects of this poet&rsquo;s
compositions were patriotic, sentimental and religious, and his poems
are characterised by deep pathos, and great sweetness of diction.]</p>
<p>When night o&rsquo;erspreads each hill and dale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath its darksome wing<br />
Are heard thy sweet and mellow notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the lone midnight ring;<br />
And if a pang within thy breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should cause thy heart to bleed,<br />
Thou wilt not hush until the dawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall drive thee from the mead.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Altho&rsquo; thy heart beneath the pang<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should falter in its throes<br />
Thou wilt not grieve thy nestlings young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy song thou wilt not close.<br />
When all the chorus of the bush<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By night and sleep are still,<br />
Thou then dost chant thy merriest lays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heaven with music fill.</p>

The lily sweet and tulip,<br />

Anoint the passing breezes<br />

of nature.]</p>
<p>How fair and fragrant art thou, May!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Replete with leaf and verdure,<br />
How sweet the blossom of the thorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which so enriches nature,<br />
The bird now sings upon the bush,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or soars through fields of azure.</p>
<p>The earth absorbs the genial rays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which vivify the summer,<br />
The busy bee hums on his way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhausting every flower,<br />
Returning to its earthen nest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laden with honied treasure.</p>
<p>How cheerful are the signs of May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lily sweet and briar,<br />
Perfuming every shady way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the warbling river;<br />
And thou, gay cuckoo! hast returned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To usher in the summer.</p>
<p>How pleasant is the cuckoo&rsquo;s song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which floats along the meadow,<br />
How rich the sight of woodland green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pastures white and yellow,<br />
The lark now soars into the heights<br />

Delightful day&mdash;shed by the sun&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaks forth from eastern skies,<br />
He&mdash;in his course o&rsquo;er oceans vast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And distant lands&mdash;returns<br />
Firm to his purpose, true his way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He nature&rsquo;s tribute earns:<br />
Before him messengers arrive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sparkle in the sky,<br />
These are the bright and twinkling stars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which spot the sable canopy.</p>
<p>The cock upon his lofty perch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has sung the break of day,<br />
The birds within the sheltering trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now frolic, chirp and play;<br />
I see all nature is astir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As tho&rsquo; from sleep restor&rsquo;d,<br />
Alive with joy and light renew&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Creator&rsquo;s word:<br />

<p><span class="smcap">By the Rev. Daniel Evans</span>, B.D.</p>
<p>Oh, flower meek and modest<br />
That blooms of all the soonest,<br />
Some great delight possesses me<br />
When thy soft crystal bud I see.</p>
<p>Thou art the first of the year<br />
To break the bonds of winter,<br />
And for thy gallant enterprise<br />
I&rsquo;ll welcome thee and sing thy praise.</p>
<p>And hast thou no misgiving?<br />
Or fear of tempests howling<br />
To issue from the hardy sod<br />
Before thy sisters break their pod?</p>
<p>Behind thee millions lie<br />
And hide their faces shy,<br />
Lest winter&rsquo;s cold continue,<br />
Or tempests charged with mildew.</p>
<p>Inform thy sisters coy<br />
The spring&rsquo;s without alloy,<br />
Tell them there is no snow<br />
Or icy wind to blow.</p>
<p>Tell them the cattle meek<br />
Will joy their heads to seek,<br />
The lamb delighted be<br />
To see them on the lea.</p>

That gleam upon the pastures,<br />
Ye white and yellow come<br />
And make the field your smiling home.</p>
<p>A thousand times more comely<br />
Your cheerful features lively,<br />
Than all the gems that shine<br />
In royal crown of princely line.</p>
<p>How pleasant then to roam<br />
Through field and forest home,<br />
And listen to the song<br />
Of birds that carol long.</p>
<h3>THE LILY AND THE ROSE.</h3>
<p>Once I saw two flowers blossom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a garden &rsquo;neath the hill,<br />
One a lily fair and handsome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one a rose with crimson frill;<br />
Erect the rose would lift its pennon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And survey the garden round,<br />
While the lily&mdash;lovely minion!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meekly rested on a mound.</p>
<p>Tempest came and blew the garden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forthwith the rose fell to the ground,<br />
While the lily, like brave maiden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Steadfast stood the stormy bound;<br />
The red rose trusting to its prowess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fell beneath the wind and rain,<br />
While the lily in its meekness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Firm did on its stalk remain.</p>

Wales, thus invokes the summer to visit the sweet pastoral county of
Glamorgan with all its blessings:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A match with time.</p>
<p>Love sat on a lotus leaf afloat,<br />
And saw old time in his loaded boat;<br />
Slowly he crossed life&rsquo;s narrow tide,<br />
While love sat clapping his wings and cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who will pass time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patience came first, but soon was gone<br />
With helm and sail to help time on;<br />
Care and grief could not lend an oar,<br />
And prudence said while he staid on shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will wait for time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hope filled with flowers her cork tree bark,<br />

they heard him coming, they said, &ldquo;It is Tr&#373;st Llywelyn,&rdquo;
(the sound of Llywelyn,) and the place has been called so ever since.&mdash;<i>Old
Story</i>.</p>
<p>It is a scene of other days,<br />
That dimly meets my fancy&rsquo;s gaze;<br />
The moon&rsquo;s fair beams are glist&rsquo;ning bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Severn&rsquo;s loveliest vale,<br />
And yonder watchtower&rsquo;s gloomy height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks stern, in her lustre pale.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Within
that turret fastness rude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three lovely forms I see,<br />
And marvel why, in that solitude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fair a group should be.</p>
<p>I know them now, that beauteous band;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the broidered vest, so rich and rare,<br />
By the sparkling gem, on the tiny hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the golden circlet in their hair,<br />
I know Llywelyn&rsquo;s sisters fair,<br />
The pride of Powys land:</p>
<p>But the proof of lineage pure and high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is better far supplied<br />
By the calm, fair brow, and fearless eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the step of graceful pride.</p>
<p>Why are the royal maidens here,<br />
Heedless of Saxon foemen near?<br />
Their only court, the minstrel sage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wakes such thrilling sound;<br />
Their train, yon petty childish page;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their guard, that gallant hound.</p>
<p>They have left their brother&rsquo;s princely hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To greet him from fight returning;<br />
And hope looks out from the eyes of all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though fear in their heart lies burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, hark!&rdquo; the eldest maiden cried,<br />
&ldquo;Kind minstrel, lay thy harp aside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And listen here with me;<br />
Did not Llywelyn&rsquo;s bugle sound<br />
From off that dark and wooded mound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You named the Goryn Dd&ucirc;?&rdquo; <a name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59">{59}</a></p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>&ldquo;No,
lady, no; my master, kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I strive in vain to hear;<br />
&rsquo;Tis but the moaning of the wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That cheats thy anxious ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second lady rous&rsquo;d her page,<br />
From the peaceful sleep of his careless age;<br />
&ldquo;Awake, fair child, from thy happy dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out o&rsquo;er the turret&rsquo;s height,<br />
Is it a lance that yonder gleams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the moonbeams blue and bright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, lady mine; not on a lance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that fair radiance quiver;<br />
I only see its lustre dance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the blue and trembling river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngest and fairest maiden sits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the turret&rsquo;s highest stone,<br />
Like the gentle flower that flings its sweets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the ruin drear and lone:</p>
<p>At her feet the hound is crouching still;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they look so calm and fair,<br />
You might almost deem, by a sculptor&rsquo;s skill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were carved in the grey stone there.</p>
<p>A distant sound the spell hath broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady and her hound<br />
Together caught the joyful token,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And down the stair they bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Trwst Llywelyn! dear sisters speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our own Llywelyn&rsquo;s near;<br />
I know the tramp of his gallant steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis music to mine ear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Yes,
&rsquo;twas his lance gleamed blue and bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His horn made the echoes ring;<br />
He is safe from a glorious field of fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his sisters round him cling:</p>
<p>And Gelert lies at his master&rsquo;s feet,<br />
The page returns to his slumbers sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The minstrel quaffs his mead,<br />
And sings Llywelyn&rsquo;s fame and power,<br />
And, Trwst Llywelyn, names the tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they heard his coming steed.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>That tower, no more, o&rsquo;erlooks the vale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But its name is unforgot,<br />
And the peasant tells the simple tale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And points to the well-known spot.</p>
<p>Oh, lady moon! thy radiance fills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An altered scene, to-night,<br />
All here is chang&rsquo;d save the changeless hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Severn, rippling bright.</p>
<p>We dwell in peace, beneath the yoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That roused our father&rsquo;s spears,<br />
The very tongue our fathers spoke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds strangely in our ears. <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61">{61}</a></p>
<p>But the human heart knows little change:<br />
&rsquo;Tis woman&rsquo;s to watch, &rsquo;tis man&rsquo;s to range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For pleasure, wealth, or fame;<br />
And thou may&rsquo;st look, from thy realms above,<br />
On many a sister&rsquo;s yearning love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The same&mdash;still, still the same.</p>

<h3>THE GOLDEN GOBLET,</h3>
<p>IN IMITATION OF G&Ouml;THE.</p>
<p>There was a king in M&ocirc;n, <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62">{62}</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A true lover to his grave;<br />
To whom in death his lady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden goblet gave.</p>
<p>When Christmas bowls were circling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all was joy and cheer,<br />
He passed that goblet from him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a kiss and with a tear.</p>
<p>When death he felt approaching,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To all his barons bold,<br />
He left some fair dominion&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To none, that cup of gold.</p>
<p>He sate at royal banquet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all his lordly train,<br />
In the castle of his fathers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the rock above the main.</p>
<p>Upstood the tottering monarch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drank the cup&rsquo;s last wine;<br />
Then flung the holy goblet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep, deep, into the brine.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>He
watch&rsquo;d it, bubbling, sinking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far, far, beneath the wave;<br />
And the light sank from his eyelid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the cup his lady gave.</p>
<h3>THE SICK MAN&rsquo;S DREAM.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Dans le solitaire bourgade,<br />
Revant &agrave; ses maux tristement,<br />
Languissait un pauvre malade,<br />
D&rsquo;un long mal qui va consumant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Millevoye</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a dream, a pleasant dream, that o&rsquo;er my spirit came,<br />
When faint beneath the lime-trees&rsquo; shade I flung my weary frame:<br />
I stood upon a mountain&rsquo;s brow, above the haunts of men,<br />
And, far beneath me, smiling, lay my lovely native glen.</p>
<p>I watch&rsquo;d the silv&rsquo;ry Severn glide, reflecting rock and
tree,<br />
A gentle pilgrim, bound to pay her homage to the sea;<br />
And waking many a treasured thought, that slumb&rsquo;ring long had
lain:<br />
Some mountain minstrel&rsquo;s harp poured forth a well remember&rsquo;d
strain.</p>
<p>I rais&rsquo;d my voice in thankfulness, and vowed no more to roam,<br />
Or leave my heart&rsquo;s abiding-place, my beauteous mountain home.<br />
Alas! how different was the scene that met my waking glance!<br />
It fell upon the fertile plains, the sunny hills of France.</p>
<p>The Garonne&rsquo;s fair and glassy wave rolls onward in its pride;<br />
It cannot quench my burning thirst for thee, my native tide;<br />
And, for the harp that bless&rsquo;d my dream with mem&rsquo;ries from
afar,<br />
I only hear yon peasant maid, who strikes the light guitar:<br />
The merry stranger mocks at griefs he does not understand,<br />
He cannot&mdash;he has never seen my own fair mountain land.</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>They
said Consumption&rsquo;s ruthless eye had mark&rsquo;d me for her prey:<br />
They bade me seek in foreign climes her wasting hand to stay;<br />
They told me of an altered form, an eye grown ghastly bright,<br />
And called the crimson on my cheek the spoiler&rsquo;s hectic blight.</p>
<p>Oh! if the mountain heather pined amidst the heaven&rsquo;s own dew,<br />
Think ye the parterre&rsquo;s wasting heat its freshness could renew?<br />
And thus, &rsquo;mid shady glens and streams, was my young life begun,<br />
And now, my frame exhausted sinks beneath this southern sun.</p>
<p>I feel, I feel, they told me true; my breath grows faint and weak,<br />
And, brighter still, this crimson spot is glowing on my cheek;<br />
My hour of life is well nigh past, too fleetly runs the sand:<br />
Oh! must I die so far from thee, my dear lov&rsquo;d mountain land?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy!&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>I am a wand&rsquo;rer o&rsquo;er earth and sea,<br />
The trackless air has a path for me;<br />
Ye may trace my steps on the heather green,<br />
By the emerald ring, where my foot hath been;<br />
Ye may hear my voice in the night wind&rsquo;s sigh,<br />
Or the wood&rsquo;s low moan when a storm is nigh.</p>
<p>My task is to brighten the rainbow&rsquo;s hue,<br />
To sprinkle the flowers with glit&rsquo;ring dew,<br />
To steep in crimson the evening cloud,<br />
And wrap the hills in their misty shroud;<br />
To track the course of a wandering star,<br />
And marshal it back to its home afar.</p>
<p>I am no child of the murky night,<br />
But a being of music, and joy, and light;<br />
If the fair moon sleep in her bower o&rsquo;er long,<br />
I break on her rest with my mirthful song;<br />
And when she is shining o&rsquo;er hill and heath,<br />
I dance in the revels of Gwyn ab N&ucirc;dd. <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65">{65}</a></p>
<p>Few are the mortals whose favoured feet<br />
May tread unscathed where the fairies meet;<br />
Wo to the tuneless tongue and ear,<br />
And the craven heart, that has throbbed with fear,<br />
If I meet them at night, on the lonely heath,<br />
As I haste to the banquet of Gwyn ab N&ucirc;dd.</p>
<p>But joy to the minstrel, whose deathless song<br />
On the breeze of the mountain is borne along,<br />
And joy to the warrior, whose heart and hand<br />
Are strong in the cause of his native land;<br />
For them we are twining our fairest wreath,<br />
They are welcome as moonlight to Gwyn ab N&ucirc;dd!</p>

Whilst chill&rsquo;d with grief, it mourns and wails<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my old Native Land.</p>
<p>Gold and wine have power to please,<br />
And Summer&rsquo;s pure and gentle breeze,&mdash;<br />
But ye are dearer far than these,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills of my Native Land.</p>
<p>Lovely to see the sun arise,<br />
Breaking forth from eastern skies;<br />
But oh! far lovelier in my eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be my Native Land.</p>

Those kings who, prodigal of breath,<br />
Rush&rsquo;d furious to the fields of death;<br />
Thy maids for peerless beauty crown&rsquo;d,<br />
In songs of ancient fame renown&rsquo;d,<br />
Pure as the gem of Arvon&rsquo;s caves,<br />
Bright as the foam of Menai&rsquo;s waves,<br />
With sunny locks and jetty eyes,<br />
Of valour&rsquo;s deeds the glorious prize,<br />
Who tam&rsquo;d to love&rsquo;s refin&rsquo;d delight<br />
Those chiefs invincible in fight.<br />
Thy sparkling horns I next recall<br />
In many a hospitable hall<br />
Circling with haste, whose boundless mirth<br />
To many an amorous lay gave birth,<br />
And many a present to the fair,<br />
And many a deed of bold despair.<br />
I love thy harps with well-rank&rsquo;d strings,<br />
Heard in the stately halls of kings,<br />
Whose sounds had magic to bestow<br />
Or sunny joy, or dusky woe.<br />
I love thy fair Silurian vales<br />
Fann&rsquo;d by Sabrina&rsquo;s temperate gales,<br />
That fir&rsquo;d the Roman to engage<br />
The scythed cars of Arvirage.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Translated by Thomas Gray</span>, Esq. <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77">{77}</a></p>
<p>[Aneurin was the son of a Welsh chieftain, and was born in the early
part of the sixth century.&nbsp; He was himself a soldier, and distinguished
himself at the battle of Cattraeth, fought between the Welsh and Saxons,
in or about the year 560, but was disastrous to the former and especially
to the bard, who was there taken prisoner, and kept for several years
in confinement.&nbsp; He composed his principal poem, the Gododin, upon
the battle of Cattraeth.&nbsp; This is the oldest Welsh poem extant,
and is full of boldness, force, and martial fire.&nbsp; It has been
translated into English by the Rev. John Williams, (ab Ithel,) and published
by the Messrs. Rees, of Llandovery.&nbsp; The bard died, according to
tradition, from the blow of an assassin before the close of the sixth
century.]</p>
<p>Had I but the torrent&rsquo;s might,<br />
With headlong rage, and wild affright,<br />
Upon De&iuml;ra&rsquo;s squadrons hurl&rsquo;d,<br />
To rush and sweep them from the world!<br />
Too, too secure in youthful pride,<br />
By them my friend, my Hoel, dy&rsquo;d,<br />
Great Cian&rsquo;s son; of Madoc old,<br />
He ask&rsquo;d no heaps of hoarded gold;<br />
Alone in Nature&rsquo;s wealth array&rsquo;d<br />
He asked and had the lovely maid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>To
Cattraeth&rsquo;s vale, in glitt&rsquo;ring row,<br />
Twice two hundred warriors go;<br />
Ev&rsquo;ry warrior&rsquo;s manly neck<br />
Chains of regal honour deck,<br />
Wreath&rsquo;d in many a golden link:<br />
From the golden cup they drink<br />
Nectar that the bees produce,<br />
Or the grape&rsquo;s ecstatic juice.<br />
Flush&rsquo;d with mirth and hope they burn,<br />
But none from Cattraeth&rsquo;s vale return,<br />
Save Aeron brave and Conan strong,<br />
(Bursting through the bloody throng,)<br />
And I, the meanest of them all,<br />
That live to weep and sing their fall.</p>
<h3>THE DEATH OF OWAIN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Aneurin</span>.</p>
<p>Lo! the youth, in mind a man,<br />
Daring in the battle&rsquo;s van;<br />
See the splendid warrior&rsquo;s speed<br />
On his fleet and thick-maned steed,<br />
As his buckler, beaming wide,<br />
Decks the courser&rsquo;s slender side,<br />
With his steel of spotless mould,<br />
Ermined vest and spurs of gold!<br />
Think not, youth, that e&rsquo;er from me<br />
Hate or spleen shall flow to thee;<br />
Nobler deeds thy virtues claim,<br />
Eulogy and tuneful fame.<br />
Ah! much sooner comes thy bier<br />
Than thy nuptial feast, I fear;<br />
Ere thou mak&rsquo;st the foe to bleed,<br />
Ravens on thy corse shall feed.<br />
Owain, lov&rsquo;d companion, friend,<br />
To birds a prey&mdash;is this thy end!<br />
Tell me, steed, on what sad plain<br />
Thy ill-fated lord was slain.</p>

LAMENT.</h3>
<p>Farewell every mountain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To memory dear,<br />
Each streamlet and fountain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pelucid and clear;<br />
Glad halls of my father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From banquets ne&rsquo;er freed,<br />
Where chieftains would gather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To quaff the bright mead,<br />
Each valley and woodland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose coverts I knew,<br />
Lov&rsquo;d haunts of my childhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever, adieu!</p>
<p>The mountains are blasted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And burnt the green wood,<br />
The fountain untasted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flows crimsoned with blood,<br />
The halls are deserted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their glory appear<br />
Like dreams of departed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And desolate years,<br />
The wild wood and valley,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The covert, the glade,<br />
Bereft of their beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Invaded! betrayed!</p>
<p>Farewell hoary minstrel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gay infancy&rsquo;s friend,<br />
What roof will protect thee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What chieftain defend?<br />
Alas for the number,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweets of their song,<br />
<!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Soon,
soon they must slumber,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountains among;<br />
The breathing of pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more will aspire,<br />
For changed is the measure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of liberty&rsquo;s lyre!</p>
<p>Adieu to the greeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of damsel and dame,<br />
When home from the beating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of foemen we came,<br />
If Edward the daughters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Walia would spare,<br />
He dooms them the fetters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of vassals to wear;<br />
To hear the war rattle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the land burn,<br />
While foes from the battle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In triumph return.</p>
<p>Farewell, and for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear land of my birth,<br />
Again we shall never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know revels or mirth,<br />
The cloud mantled castle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My ancestors&rsquo; pride,<br />
The pleasure and wassail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In rapture allied;<br />
The preludes of danger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Approach thee from far,<br />
The spears of strangers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The beacons of war.</p>
<p>Farewell to the glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I dreamed of in vain;<br />
Behold on the story<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A blood tinctured stain!<br />
Nor this the sole token<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The records can blast,<br />
Our lances are broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our trophies are lost;<br />

While fair sails are swelling<br />

Thus part and for ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit to our doom?<br />
Ah! let me not linger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus long by the way<br />
Lest memory&rsquo;s finger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unman me for aye!</p>
<p>Hark, hart, yonder bugle!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Gwalchmai&rsquo;s shrill blast<br />
Exclaiming one struggle,<br />

Another, another!<br />

The chieftain was fighting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His way to renown;<br />
But ere morn had risen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In purple and gold,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; In heaps round his grave;<br />

BATTLE OF GWENYSTRAD.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Taliesin</span>.</p>
<p>[Taliesin was the greatest of the ancient Welsh bards, and was a
contemporary of Aneurin in the sixth century.&nbsp; He appears to have
been a native of Cardiganshire, for we find him at an early age living
at the court of Gwyddno, a petty king of Cantre y Gwaelod, who appointed
him his chief bard and tutor to his son Elphin.&nbsp; He was afterwards
attached to the court of Urien Rheged, a Welsh prince, king of Cambria
and of Scotland as far as the river Clyde, who fought and conquered
in the great battle of Gwenystrad, and is celebrated by the bard in
the following song.&nbsp; Taliesin composed many poems, but seventy
seven of them only have been preserved.&nbsp; The subjects of his poetry
were for the most part religion and history, but a few of his poems
were of a martial character.]</p>
<p>If warlike chiefs with dawning day<br />
At Cattraeth met in dread array,<br />
The song records their splendid name;<br />
But who shall sing of Urien&rsquo;s fame?<br />
His patriot virtues far excel<br />
Whate&rsquo;er the boldest bard can tell:<br />
His dreadful arm and dauntless brow<br />
Spoil and dismay the haughty foe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar of Britain&rsquo;s regal line!<br />
&rsquo;Tis his in glorious war to shine;<br />
Despair and death attend his course,<br />
Brave leader of the Christian force!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Prydyn&rsquo;s men, a valiant train,<br />
Rush along Gwenystrad&rsquo;s plain!<br />
Bright their spears for war addrest,<br />
Raging vengeance fires their breast;<br />
Shouts like ocean&rsquo;s roar arise,<br />
Tear the air, and pierce the skies.<br />
Here they urge their tempest force!<br />
Nor camp nor forest turns their course:<br />
Their breath the shrieking peasants yield<br />
O&rsquo;er all the desolated field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>But
lo, the daring hosts engage!<br />
Dauntless hearts and flaming rage;<br />
And, ere the direful morn is o&rsquo;er,<br />
Mangled limbs and reeking gore,<br />
And crimson torrents whelm the ground,<br />
Wild destruction stalking round;<br />
Fainting warriors gasp for breath,<br />
Or struggle in the toils of death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the embattled fortress rose,<br />
(Gwenystrad&rsquo;s bulwark from the foes,)<br />
Fierce conflicting heroes meet&mdash;<br />
Groans the earth beneath their feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mark, amidst the rolling flood,<br />
Where hardy warriors stain&rsquo;d with blood<br />
Drop their blunt arms, and join the dead,<br />
Grey billows curling o&rsquo;er their head:<br />
Mangled with wounds, and vainly brave,<br />
At once they sink beneath the wave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lull&rsquo;d to everlasting rest,<br />
With folded arms and gory breast&mdash;<br />
Cold in death, and ghastly pale,<br />
Chieftains press the reeky vale,<br />
Who late, amidst their kindred throng,<br />
Prepar&rsquo;d the feast, and join&rsquo;d the song;<br />
Or like the sudden tempest rose,<br />
And hurl&rsquo;d destruction on the foes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors I saw who led the fray,<br />
Stern desolation strew&rsquo;d their way;<br />
Aloft the glitt&rsquo;ring blade they bore,<br />
Their garments hung with clotted gore.<br />
The furious thrust, the clanging shield,<br />
Confound the long-disputed field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Rheged&rsquo;s chief pursues,<br />
His way through iron ranks he hews;<br />
Hills pil&rsquo;d on hills, the strangers bleed:<br />
Amaz&rsquo;d I view his daring deed!<br />
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Destruction
frowning on his brow,<br />
Close he urg&rsquo;d the panting foe,<br />
&rsquo;Till hemm&rsquo;d around, they met the shock,<br />
Before Galysten&rsquo;s hoary rock.<br />
Death and torment strew&rsquo;d his path;<br />
His dreadful blade obey&rsquo;d his wrath:<br />
Beneath their shields the strangers lay,<br />
Shrinking from the fatal day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in victorious armour bright,<br />
Thou brave Euronwy, pant for fight:<br />
With such examples in thine eyes,<br />
Haste to grasp the hero&rsquo;s prize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And till old age has left me dumb&mdash;<br />
Till death has call&rsquo;d me to the tomb&mdash;<br />
May cheerful joys ne&rsquo;er crown my days,<br />
Unless I sing of Urien&rsquo;s praise!</p>

<p>A voice from time departed, yet floats thy hills among,<br />
O Cambria! thus thy prophet bard, thy Taliesin sung,<br />
The path of unborn ages is trac&rsquo;d upon my soul,<br />
The clouds, which mantle things unseen, away before me roll.</p>
<p>A light, the depths revealing, hath o&rsquo;er my spirit passed;<br />
A rushing sound from days to be swells fitful on the blast,<br />
And tells me that for ever shall live the lofty tongue,<br />
To which the harp of Mona&rsquo;s woods by Freedom&rsquo;s hand was
strung.</p>

I see from Uthyr&rsquo;s <a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b">{87b}</a>

And many a line of bards and chiefs, and princely men decay.</p>
<p>But long as Arvon&rsquo;s mountains shall lift their sovereign forms,<br />
And wear the crown to which is giv&rsquo;n dominion o&rsquo;er the storms,<br />

Your walls were a shelter the strongest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the enemies&rsquo; countless array,<br />
When they spilt with the blood of the bravest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sides in our ancestors&rsquo; day.</p>
<p>Around you the war-horse was neighing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pranced his rich trappings to feel,<br />
While through you were frightfully gleaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright lances and spears of steel;<br />
The fruits of the rich-laden harvest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were ruthlessly trod by the foe,<br />
And the thunder of battle was loudest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To herald its message of woe.</p>
<p>While viewing your dilapidation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My memory kindles with joy,<br />
To think that the foes of our nation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No longer these valleys destroy;<br />
By sowing his fields in the winter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope of a rich harvest-home,<br />
The husbandman now feels no terror<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of war with its havoc to come.</p>
<p>When I look at the sheep as they shelter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In safety beneath your rude walls,<br />
Where erst the dread agents of slaughter<br />

<p>Ye towers that saw the wild ravens,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the eagles with hunger impell&rsquo;d,<br />
Exultingly gorge &rsquo;mid your ruins.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On corpses of men which they held;<br />
How sweet for you now &rsquo;tis to hear<br />

Tune his reed with a melody clear,<br />

<p>Upon your battlements sitting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To view the bright landscape below,<br />
My heart becomes sad when remembering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That silent in death is the foe,<br />
And the friends who bravely did combat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And raised your grey towers so steep,<br />
Declaring their life-blood should stagnate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere ever in chains they would weep.</p>
<p>When I think of their purpose so pure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tear must fast trickle from me,<br />
Their hearts did Providence allure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To their country, and her did they free;<br />

HEN&rsquo;S LAMENT ON CYNDDYLAN.</h3>
<p>[Llywarch Hen, warrior and poet, was the contemporary of Aneurin
and Taliesin in the sixth century.&nbsp; He was engaged at the battle
of Cattraeth, where he witnessed the fall of three of his sons, and
in the endless wars of that period.&nbsp; He had twenty four sons, all
of whom were slain in battle in the bard&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp; He
retired for refuge to the Court of Cynddylan, then Prince of Powys,
at Pengwern, now Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The Saxons at length drove Cynddylan
from Pengwern, and the bard retired to Llanfor, near Bala, in Merionethshire,
where he died at the long age of 150 years.&nbsp; Hence the appellation
<i>hen</i>, or the aged.&nbsp; Twelve poems of this bard remain, but
all are imbued with the melancholy of the poet&rsquo;s life.]</p>
<p>Cynddylan&rsquo;s hearth is dark to-night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cynddylan&rsquo;s halls are lone;<br />
War&rsquo;s fire has revell&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er their might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still&rsquo;d their minstrel&rsquo;s tone;<br />
And I am left to chant apart<br />
One murmur of a broken heart!</p>
<p>Pengwern&rsquo;s blue spears are gleamless now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her revelry is still;<br />
The sword has blanched his chieftain&rsquo;s brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fearless sons are chill:<br />

One palace pillar stands to guide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The woodbine&rsquo;s verdant braiding;<br />
And I am left, from all apart,<br />
The minstrel of the broken heart!</p>

<p>The bright hours return, and the blue sky is ringing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With song, and the hills are all mantled with bloom;<br />
But fairer than aught which the summer is bringing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The beauty and youth gone to people the tomb!</p>
<p>Oh! why should I live to hear music resounding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cannot awake ye, my lovely, my brave?<br />
Why smile the waste flow&rsquo;rs, my sad footsteps surrounding?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My sons! they but clothe the green turf of your grave!</p>
<p>Fair were ye, my sons! and all kingly your bearing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As on to the fields of your glory you trod!<br />
Each prince of my race the bright golden chain wearing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each eye glancing fire, shrouded now by the sod!</p>
<p>I weep when the blast of the trumpet is sounding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which rouses ye not, oh, my lovely, my brave!<br />
When warriors and chiefs to their proud steeds are bounding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn from heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s light, for it smiles on
your grave!</p>
<h3>THE HALL OF CYNDDYLAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Mrs. Hemans</span>.</p>
<p>The Hall of Cynddylan is gloomy to-night,<br />
I weep, for the grave has extinguished its light;<br />
The beam of its lamp from the summit is o&rsquo;er,<br />
The blaze of its hearth shall give welcome no more!</p>
<p>The Hall of Cynddylan is voiceless and still,<br />
The sound of its harpings hath died on the hill!<br />
Be silent for ever, thou desolate scene,<br />
Nor let e&rsquo;en an echo recall what hath been!</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>The
Hall of Cynddylan is lonely and bare,<br />
No banquet, no guest, not a footstep is there!<br />
Oh! where are the warriors who circled its board?&mdash;<br />
The grass will soon wave where the mead-cup was pour&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The Hall of Cynddylan is loveless to-night,<br />
Since he is departed whose smile made it bright:<br />
I mourn, but the sigh of my soul shall be brief,<br />
The pathway is short to the grave of my chief!</p>
<h3>THE GRAVE OF KING ARTHUR. <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a">{94a}</a></h3>
<p>I called on the sun, in his noonday height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the power and spell a wizard gave:<br />
Hast thou not found, with thy searching light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The island monarch&rsquo;s grave?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smile on many a lordly tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Death is mock&rsquo;d by trophies fair;<br />
I pierce the dim aisle&rsquo;s hallow&rsquo;d gloom;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; King Arthur sleeps not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched for the night&rsquo;s most lovely star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, by that spell, I bade her say,<br />
If she had been, in her wand&rsquo;rings far,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the slain of Gamlan lay. <a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b">{94b}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well do I love to shine upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lonely cairn on the dark hill&rsquo;s side,<br />
And I weep at night o&rsquo;er the brave ones gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not o&rsquo;er Britain&rsquo;s pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>I
bent o&rsquo;er the river, winding slow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through tangled brake and rocky bed:<br />
Say, do thy waters mourning flow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the mighty dead?</p>
<p>The river spake through the stilly hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a voice like the deep wood&rsquo;s evening sigh:<br />
&ldquo;I am wand&rsquo;ring on, &rsquo;mid shine and shower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But that grave I pass not by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bade the winds their swift course hold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they swept in their strength the mountain&rsquo;s bre&rsquo;st:<br />
Ye have waved the dragon banner&rsquo;s fold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does its chieftain rest?</p>
<p>There came from the winds a murmured note,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not ours that mystery of the world;<br />
But the dragon banner yet shall float<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the mountain breeze unfurl&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answer me then, thou ocean deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Insatiate gulf of things gone by,<br />
In thy green halls does the hero sleep?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wild waves made reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sleeps not in our sounding cells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our coral beds with jewels pearl&rsquo;d;<br />
Not in our treasure depths it dwells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That mystery of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long must the island monarch roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble heart and the mighty hand;<br />
But we shall bear him proudly home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his father&rsquo;s mountain land.&rdquo;</p>

VENGEANCE OF OWAIN. <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96">{96}</a></h3>
<p>[Owain Gwynedd, the subject of the following poem was the eldest
son of Gruffydd ab Cynan, Prince of Gwynedd, or North Wales, and he
succeeded his father on his death in 1137.&nbsp; Father and son were
illustrious warriors and patriotic rulers.&nbsp; They were also celebrated
for their munificent protection of the Welsh Bards.&nbsp; The Saxons
had established themselves at the castle of Wyddgrug, now Mold, and
thence committed great ravages on the Welsh in that vicinity.&nbsp;
Owain collected his forces, and by a sudden and fierce attack he conquered
the Saxons in their stronghold, and afterwards razed it with the ground
in 1144.&nbsp; This celebrated Prince died in 1162, and was buried at
Bangor, where a monument to his memory still remains.]</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It may be bowed<br />
With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb<br />
That weighed upon her gentle dust, a cloud<br />
Might gather o&rsquo;er her beauty, and a gloom<br />
In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom,<br />
Heaven gives its favourites&mdash;early death.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">childe harold</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Gwynedd, fast thy star declineth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy name is gone, thy rights invaded,<br />
And hopelessly the strong oak pineth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the tall sapling faded;<br />

mountain eagle idly cowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside his slaughtered young,<br />
Our sons must bow to other powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must learn a stranger tongue.<br />
Pride, valour, freedom, treasures that have been,<br />
Do they all slumber in the grave of Rh&ucirc;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus sad and low the murmurs spread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round Owain&rsquo;s stately walls,<br />
While he, a mourner o&rsquo;er the dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sate lonely in his halls;<br />
And not the hardiest warrior there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unpitying, might blame<br />
The reckless frenzy of despair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shook that iron frame;<br />
Eyes that had coldly gazed on woman&rsquo;s grief,<br />
Wept o&rsquo;er the anguish of their stern old chief.</p>
<p>Not all unheard those murmurs past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They reached a lady&rsquo;s bower,<br />
Where meekly drooped beneath the blast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud Gwynedd&rsquo;s peerless flower;<br />
And she, the hero&rsquo;s widow&rsquo;d bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has roused her from her sorrow&rsquo;s spell,<br />
And vowed one effort should be tried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For that fair land he loved so well.</p>
<p>There came a footstep, light and lone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To break the Chieftain&rsquo;s solitude,<br />
And, bending o&rsquo;er a harp&rsquo;s low tone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A form of fragile beauty stood;<br />
More like the maid, in fairy lay, <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97">{97}</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose very being was of flowers,<br />
Than creature, moulded from the clay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dwell in this cold sphere of ours.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Her
snowy brow through dark locks gleamed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And long and shadowy lashes curled,<br />
O&rsquo;er eyes whose deep&rsquo;ning radiance seemed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Caught from the light of another world;<br />
And on her cheek there was a glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like clouds that kiss the parting sun;<br />
Death&rsquo;s crimson banner, spread to show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His mournful triumph was begun.</p>
<p>Has grief so dulled Prince Owain&rsquo;s ear,<br />
Her melody he may not hear?<br />
No kindly look, or word, or token,<br />
His trance of wretchedness has broken,<br />
Yet knows she, in that lonely spot,<br />
Her presence felt, tho&rsquo; greeted not;<br />
Knows that no foot, save hers, unbidden;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had dared to tread the living tomb,<br />
No other hand had waked, unchidden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The echoes of that sullen gloom;<br />
And now her voice&rsquo;s gentle tone<br />
Blends with the harp, in dirge-like moan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mourn for Rh&ucirc;n; the spider&rsquo;s patient trail<br />
Hangs fairy cordage round his useless mail;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pennon, never seen to yield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bends in the light breeze, idly gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rusted spear, and riven shield<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell of a warrior past away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mourn for Rh&ucirc;n; alas! the damp earth lies<br />
Heavy and chill on those unconscious eyes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around those cold and powerless fingers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earthworm coils her slimy rings;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above his grave the wild bird lingers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And many a requiem o&rsquo;er it sings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mourn for Rh&ucirc;n; doth not the stranger tread,<br />
With spurning foot, upon his lowly bed?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Doth
not his spirit wailing roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land his dying wishes bless&rsquo;d?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And finds, within the Cymry&rsquo;s home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the oppressor and oppress&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minstrel pauses in her strain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To gaze on Owain&rsquo;s altered brow,<br />
Where shame and sorrow, pride and pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are striving for the mastery now.</p>
<p>Not long the pause, again she flings<br />
Her fingers o&rsquo;er the sounding strings;<br />
Mournfully still, yet hurriedly,<br />
Waking a bolder melody;<br />
Her form assumes a loftier height,<br />
Her dark eyes flash more wildly bright,<br />
And the voice, that seem&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the ear to float,<br />
Now stirs the heart like a trumpet&rsquo;s note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence is the light on my spirit cast,<br />
A glance of the future, a dream of the past?<br />
There&rsquo;s a coming sound in the shelter&rsquo;d glen,<br />
Like the measur&rsquo;d tread of warlike men,<br />
And the mingled hum of a gathering crowd,<br />
And the war-cry echoing far and loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear their shields and corselets clashing,<br />
I see the gleam of their blue spears flashing,<br />
And the sun on plume-deck&rsquo;d helmets glance,<br />
And the banners that on the free wind dance,<br />
And the steed of the chief in his gallant array<br />
As he rushes to glory, away, away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweep on, sweep on, in your crushing might,<br />
Bear ye that banner o&rsquo;er hill and height!<br />
Sweep on, sweep on, in your &rsquo;whelming wrath,<br />
The far-scented raven shall follow your path;<br />
<!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Let
him track the step of the mountain ranger,<br />
And his beak shall be red with the blood of the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On, for the fortress, whose gloomy height<br />
Looks down on the valley in scornful might,<br />
Leave not one stone on another to tell<br />
That the Saxon has dwelt where no more he shall dwell;<br />
Let the green weed o&rsquo;ershadow the desolate hearth<br />
That has rung to the spoiler&rsquo;s exulting mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On!&nbsp; When the strife grows fierce and high,<br />
Vengeance and Rh&ucirc;n be your battle-cry!<br />
Star of the Cymry! can it be<br />
They go to conquer and not with thee?<br />
Thy blood is on the foeman&rsquo;s glaive,<br />
My lost, my beautiful, my brave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song has ceased, but ere its close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lustre from those eyes is gone,<br />
The cheek has lost its crimson rose,<br />
The voice has changed its thrilling tone,<br />
Till the last notes in murmurs die,<br />
Faint as the echo of a sigh.</p>
<p>The task is done, the spell is cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, left in silent loneliness,<br />
The o&rsquo;erwrought spirit breaks at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands her throbbing temples press,<br />
And tears are gushing fast and bright,<br />
Down those small palms and fingers slight.</p>
<p>Oh, human love! how beautiful thou art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shading the ruin, clinging round the tomb,<br />
And ling&rsquo;ring still, tho&rsquo; all beside depart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the cold sceptic, with his creed of gloom,<br />
Deem that thy final dwelling is the dust,<br />
Thy faith but folly, nothingness thy trust?</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>The
Saxon feasted high that night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Wyddgrug&rsquo;s fortress proud,<br />
Where countless torches lent their light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the song of mirth was loud;<br />
And ruby juice of Southern vine<br />
Sparkled in cups of golden shine.</p>
<p>Sudden there rose a fearful cry,<br />
That drowned the voice of revelry,<br />
And then a glare so fiercely bright,<br />
It paled the torches&rsquo; waning light,<br />
And as its blaze more redly glowed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving no niche or grey stone darkling,<br />
A deep and deadly current flowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mingle with the wine-cup&rsquo;s sparkling.</p>
<p>And, in that triumph&rsquo;s wild&rsquo;ring hour<br />
Of sated vengeance, grappled power,<br />
Owain has lost the show of grief,<br />
Once more his Cymry&rsquo;s warlike chief,<br />
With dauntless mien he proudly stands,<br />
The centre of his faithful bands,<br />
Who gladly view the haughty brow,<br />
Whence care and pain seem banished now,<br />
And little reck what deeper lies,<br />
All is not joy that wears its guise,<br />
And, not, &rsquo;mid valour&rsquo;s trophies won,<br />
Can he forget his slaughtered son.</p>
<p>Forget! no, time and absence have estranged<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who in sundered paths must tread,<br />
We may forget the distant or the changed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not&mdash;oh, not the dead:<br />
All other things, that round us come and pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some with&rsquo;ring chance or change have proved,<br />
But they still bear, in mem&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s magic glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The semblance we have loved.</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>The
morning breaks all calm and bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On ruins stern and bloody plain,<br />
Flinging her rich and growing light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er many a ghastly heap of slain;<br />
And pure and fresh her lustre showers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On shattered helm and dinted mail,<br />
As when her coming wakes the flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In some peace-hallow&rsquo;d vale.</p>
<p>But where is she, whose voice had power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To rouse the war storm&rsquo;s awful might?<br />
Glad eager footsteps seek her bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With tidings of the glorious fight;<br />
On her loved harp her head is bowed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One slender arm still round it clings,<br />
And her dark tresses in a cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are clust&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er the silent strings.<br />
They clasp her hands, they call her name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They bid her strike the harp once more,<br />
And sing of victory, and fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The song she loved in days of yore.<br />
Vain, vain, there comes no breath or sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those faded lips to sever,<br />
The broken heart its rest hath found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The harp is hushed for ever.</p>

OF THE FOSTER-SON, LOVE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Rev. Daniel evans</span>, B.D.</p>
<p>I got a foster-son, whose name was Love,<br />
From one endued with beauty from above.<br />
To bring him up with fond and <i>tender</i> care&mdash;<br />
Was an obligation from my fair.&mdash;</p>
<p>And for the guileless, beaming star&rsquo;s sweet sake<br />
Him to my bosom did I kindly take,<br />
Him warmly cherished and with joy caress&rsquo;d,<br />
Like Philomela in the parent breast!</p>
<p>Thus on my breast, and sipping from my cup,<br />
With food and nurture did I bring him up;<br />
He grew a winged stripling, plump and fair,<br />
And yet he filled and fills my soul with care!</p>
<p>Foster-son, indeed, a rebel has become,<br />
Morose, insubordinate and glum,<br />
A peevish, wayward, wanton, wicked swain:<br />
To strive against the darts of love is vain.</p>
<p>And now with his ruthless, vengeful bow,<br />
He points it at me and shoots high and low.<br />
Ah! whither shall I from his anger flee;<br />
Where from his darts and wily snares be free?</p>
<p>All fickle is the foster-son, indeed;<br />
He leads me on to the flowery mead,<br />
When all is peace and harmony around<br />
He wrings my ears with doleful sound.</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>And
woe betide if e&rsquo;er he sees one dare<br />
A single word exchange with the fair,<br />
He forthwith casts his vengeance like a dart,<br />
And thrusts his pointed dagger through my heart.</p>
<p>One day, when feeling somewhat brisk and strong<br />
On summer-morn, I strolled the meads along,<br />
A curious thought upon my mind did flash<br />
That I would try this foster-boy to thrash.</p>
<p>With this intent I straightway armed myself,<br />
My oaken cudgel drew to chase the elf;<br />
When lo! the elf felt not the slightest stroke,<br />
But in return the tendrils of my heart he broke!</p>
<p>I am father to a foster-son<br />
Most cruel since this earth began to run:<br />
Oh, thousand times how sorely have I said,<br />
&ldquo;The fates may take him, foster&rsquo;d on my bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then must I live in sorrow evermore<br />
No hope to cheer my spirit as of yore?<br />
And is despair, dark, sullen, on my heart<br />
To plant its talons with a fatal dart?</p>
<p>No, there yet will beam a brilliant day<br />
To chase these lurid, murky clouds away!<br />
Arise, sweet soul, thy sorrows cast away,<br />
Blow off thy cares, like ocean&rsquo;s shifting spray.</p>
<p>There is a blushing rose that blooms unseen<br />
In yonder valley decked with leaflets green,<br />
&rsquo;Twill healthy heart, tho&rsquo; shatter&rsquo;d and forlorn,<br />
Like scented balm from distant Gilead borne.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis there my darling Dora makes her home;<br />
&rsquo;Tis there my wand&rsquo;ring glances fondly roam;<br />
&rsquo;Tis there my star of beauty mildly shines;<br />
&rsquo;Tis there the chain of life my soul entwines.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>&rsquo;Tis
there where kind maternal fondness dwells,<br />
And sister gentleness the bosom swells,<br />
&rsquo;Tis there where now the lovely lily grows<br />
Beside the purling brook that ever flows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one, and only one to cheer my soul,<br />
To heal my anguish, and my grief control;<br />
&rsquo;Tis she who did the foster-boy impart<br />
To nestle deeply in my restless heart.</p>
<p>And if, indeed, the fair one will not pay<br />
For time and nurture, anguish and delay,<br />
Unless a guerdon in her smiles I see<br />
Then must I from her arms for ever flee.</p>
<h3>PENNILLION.</h3>
<p>[Pennillion singing formed quite a feature in the eisteddfodau of
the Cymry, and was much practised in the houses of the Welsh gentry.&nbsp;
The pennillion were sung by one voice to the harp, and followed a quaint
air which was not only interesting, but owing to its peculiarity, it
set forth in a striking manner the humour of the verse.&nbsp; This practice,
which was quite a Welsh institution, is fast dying out, and is not now
much in use except at eisteddfodau.]</p>

V.&nbsp; THE SENTIMENTAL.</h2>
<h3>THE ROSE OF LLAN MEILEN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Dafydd Ab Gwilym</span>.</p>
<p>Sweet Rose of Llan Meilen! you bid me forget<br />
That ever in moments of pleasure we met;<br />
You bid me remember no longer a name<br />
The muse hath already companioned with fame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And future ap Gwilyms, fresh wreaths who compose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall twine with the chaplet of song for the brows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of each fair Morvida, Llan Meilen&rsquo;s sweet Rose.</p>
<p>Had the love I had loved been inconstant or gay,<br />
Enduring at most but a long summer&rsquo;s day,<br />
Growing cold when the splendour of noontide hath set,<br />
I might have forgotten that ever we met.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But long as Eryri its peak shall expose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sunshine of summer, or winter&rsquo;s cold snows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My love will endure for Llan Meilen&rsquo;s sweet Rose.</p>
<p>Then bid me not, maiden, remember no more<br />
A name which affection and love must adore,<br />
&rsquo;Till affection and love become one with the breath<br />
Of life in the silent oblivion of death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance in that hour of the spirit&rsquo;s repose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not until then, when the dark eyelids close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can this fond heart forget thee, Llan Meilen&rsquo;s sweet
Rose.</p>
<h3><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>MY
NATIVE COT.</h3>
<p>The white cot where I spent my youth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is on yon lofty mountain side,<br />
The stream which flowed beside the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adown the mossy slope doth glide;<br />
The holly tree that hid one end<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is shaken by the moaning wind,<br />
Like as it was in days of yore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When &rsquo;neath its boughs I shade did find.</p>
<p>Clear is the sky of morning tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright is the season time of youth,<br />
Before the mid-day clouds appear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fell deceit obliterates truth;<br />
Black tempest in the evening lowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain descends with whirlwind force,<br />
And long ere midnight&rsquo;s hour nears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full is the heart of deep remorse.</p>
<p>Where are my old companions dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in those days with me did play?<br />
The green graves in the parish yard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will soon the mournful answer say:<br />
Farewell therefore ye pleasures light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which in my youth I did enjoy,<br />
Dark evening&rsquo;s come with all its trials,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And these the bliss of life destroy.</p>
<h3><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>UNDER
THE ORCHARD TREE.</h3>
<p>Under the deep-laden boughs of the orchard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Walks a maid that is fairer than all its rich fruit,<br />
And little I doubt if I stood beneath them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which of the objects I&rsquo;d offer my suit.<br />
&rsquo;Twas little I thought when I was a stripling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While gazing upon the apples so sweet,<br />
I ever should see beneath the green branches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An object which yet I much sooner would greet.</p>
<p>Thy father was careful about his rich orchard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fence well and strong lest the neighbours should stray,<br />
For now there doth, wander amid its green arbours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A maiden more lovely than aught in the way;<br />
Its fruit I would leave to the one who may wish it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But her, who moves so majestic between,<br />
I&rsquo;d steal from the orchard without a misgiving,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never would touch its apples so green.</p>
<h3>THE BANKS OF THE DEE.</h3>
<p>One morning in May, when soft breezes were blowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er Dee&rsquo;s pleasant tide with a ripple and
swell,<br />
A shepherdess tended her flock that was feeding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the green meadows that lay in the dell,<br />
Her blue eye she raised, and she looked all around her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if she&rsquo;d fain see some one far on the lea,<br />
And spite of its brightness, I saw the salt tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For one who was far from the banks of the Dee.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>The
maiden I thought was preparing to solace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her stay with a song amid the fair scene,<br />
Nor long was I left in suspense of her object,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she broke forth with a melody clean;<br />
The tears she would wipe away with her napkin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While often a sigh would escape from her breast,<br />
And as she sent forth the notes of her mourning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I could find that to love the lay was address&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four summers have pass&rsquo;d since I lost my sweet William,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from this fair valley he mournful did go;<br />
Four autumns have shower&rsquo;d their leaves on the meadows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he on these eyelids a smile did bestow;<br />
Four winters have sped with their snowflakes and tempest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he by my side did sing a light glee;<br />
But many more springs will be sown for the harvest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere William revisit the banks of the Dee.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>GWILYM GLYN AND RUTH OF DYFFRYN.</h3>
<p>In the depth of yonder valley,<br />
Where the fields are bright and sunny,<br />
Ruth was nurtured fair and slender<br />
Neath a mother&rsquo;s eye so tender.</p>
<p>Listening to the thrush&rsquo;s carols.<br />
Was her pleasure in her gambols,<br />
And ere she grew up a maiden<br />
Gwilym&rsquo;s voice was sweet in Dyffryn.</p>
<p>Together did they play in childhood,<br />
Together ramble in the greenwood,<br />
Together dance upon the meadow,<br />
Together pluck the primrose yellow.</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Both
grew up in youthful beauty<br />
On the lap of peace and plenty,<br />
And before they could discover<br />
Love had linked its silent fetter.</p>
<p>Ruth had riches&mdash;not so Gwilym,<br />
Her stern sire grew cold unto him,<br />
And at length forbade him coming<br />
Any more to visit Dyffryn.</p>
<p>Gwilym thence would roam the wild-wood,<br />
Where he wander&rsquo;d in his childhood,<br />
And would shun his home and hamlet,<br />
Pensive sitting in the thicket.</p>
<p>Ruth would, weeping, walk the garden,<br />
And survey the blank horizon<br />
For a passing glimpse of Gwilym&mdash;<br />
But all vain her tears and wailing.</p>
<p>Gwilym said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cross the ocean,<br />
And abide among the heathen,<br />
In the hope of getting riches,<br />
Which alone the father pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, before he left his country,<br />
Once, by stealth, he met the lady,<br />
And beneath the beech&rsquo;s shadow<br />
Vow&rsquo;d undying love in sorrow.</p>
<p>Much the weeping&mdash;sad the sighing,<br />
When they parted in the gloaming,<br />
Gwilym for a distant region,<br />
Ruth behind in desolation.</p>
<p>Time flew fast, and many a wooer<br />
Came to Ruth an ardent lover;<br />
But in vain they sought the maiden,<br />
For she held her troth unbroken.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Owain
Wynn had wealth in plenty,<br />
Earnest was his deep entreaty,<br />
And tho&rsquo; favour&rsquo;d by the father,<br />
Yet all vain was his endeavour.</p>
<p>Years now pass&rsquo;d since Ruth saw Gwilym,<br />
But her dreams were always of him,<br />
And tho&rsquo; morning undeceived her,<br />
Nightly did she see him near.</p>
<p>One fair evening Ruth was sitting<br />
In the spot of their last parting,<br />
When she thought she saw her Gwilym<br />
Cross the meadows green of Dyffryn.</p>
<p>Was it fact or apparition?<br />
Slow she mov&rsquo;d to test the vision,<br />
Who was there but her own true love<br />
Come to claim her in the green grove.</p>
<p>Gwilym now possessed abundance,<br />
Gold and pearls displayed their radiance,<br />
Soon the father gave him welcome<br />
To his house and daughter handsome.</p>
<p>Quick the wedding-day was settled,<br />
Ruth to Gwilym then was married,<br />
Long they lived in bliss and plenty,<br />
Pride and envy of the valley.</p>

LORD OF CLAS.</h3>
<p>The Lord of Cl&acirc;s to his hunting is gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over plain and sedgy moor;<br />
The glare of his bridle bit has shone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the heights of wild Benmore.</p>
<p>Why does he stay away from hound?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor urge the fervid chase?<br />
Where is the shrill blast of his bugle sound?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bloom of his radiant face?</p>
<p>The Lord of Cl&acirc;s has found other game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the buck and timid roe;<br />
His heart is warm&rsquo;d by other flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes with love-light glow.</p>
<p>On the mountain side a damsel he met<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting flowers wild;<br />
Her eyes like diamonds were set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And modest as a child.</p>
<p>Fair was her face, and lovely to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her form of slender mould,<br />
Her dark hair waved in tresses free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On shoulders arch and bold.</p>
<p>The Lord of Cl&acirc;s did blush and sigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lovely maid he saw;<br />
He stoutly tried to pass her by;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bridle rein did draw.</p>
<p>But his heart quick flutter&rsquo;d in his breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rein fell from his hand,<br />
In accents weak the maid address&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While trembling did he stand.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>&ldquo;Fair

&nbsp;&nbsp; And what your purpose here?<br />

&ldquo;I know not, sir, why you should glean<br />

<p>The chieftain high was now subdu&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lower&rsquo;d was his crest;<br />
With deep humility imbued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maid he thus address&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady fair, your beauteous mien<br />

Altho&rsquo; I hear the chase so keen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My thoughts with you do rest.</p>
<p>I did essay to pass your charms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spurr&rsquo;d my steed to flight,<br />
But your dazzling beauty numb&rsquo;d my arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And chain&rsquo;d me to your sight.</p>
<p>If I may humbly crave your love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you my degree:<br />
I am the Lord of yonder grove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of this mountain free.</p>
<p>These broad lands will your dowry be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you my suit receive,<br />
And ye shall urge the chase with me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From morn to winter eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>The

<p>My tried and trusty mountain steed,<br />
Of Aberteivi&rsquo;s hardy breed,<br />
Elate of spirit, low of flesh,<br />

And three score miles and twelve a day<br />
Hast sped, my gallant galloway.</p>

Dancing on the ocean, light,<br />
That the spirit of the wind<br />
Actuates to heart and mind<br />
Elastic, buoyant, proud, and gay,<br />
Art thou, my mountain galloway.</p>
<p>Thou&rsquo;st borne me, like a billow&rsquo;s sweep,<br />
O&rsquo;er mountains high and vallies deep,<br />
Oft drank at lake and waterfall,<br />
Pass&rsquo;d sunless gulfs whose glooms appall,<br />
And shudder&rsquo;d oft at ocean&rsquo;s spray,<br />
Where breakers roar&rsquo;d, destruction lay.</p>

<h3>GLAN GEIRIONYDD.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From the Rev. Evan Evans</span>.</p>
<p>One time upon a summer day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I saunter&rsquo;d on the shore<br />
Of swift Geirionydd&rsquo;s waters blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where oft I walked before<br />
In youth&rsquo;s bright season gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spent life&rsquo;s happiest morn<br />
In drawing from its crystal waves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trout beneath the thorn,<br />
When every thought within my breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was light as solar ray,<br />
Enjoying every pastime dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the livelong day.</p>
<p>The breeze would soften on the lake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unruffled be its deep,<br />
And all surrounding nature be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As calm as silent sleep,<br />
Except the raven&rsquo;s dismal shriek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the lofty spray,<br />
And bleat of sheep beside the bush<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where light their lambkins play,<br />
And noise made by the busy mill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the river shore,<br />
With cuckoo&rsquo;s song perch&rsquo;d in the ash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To show that winter&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>The impressive scene would rather tend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To nurse reflection deep,<br />
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Than
cast the gay and sprightly fly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the rocky steep;<br />
&rsquo;Twould fill my spirit now subdued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sober earnest thought,<br />
Of other days, and other things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My youthful hands had wrought;<br />
The tears would spring into my eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart with heaving fill,<br />
To think of all that I had been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all that I am still.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The sober stillness would beget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts of departed friends,<br />
Who not long since companions were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the river&rsquo;s bends;<br />
And soon will come the sombre day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I shall meet their doom,<br />
And &rsquo;stead of fishing by the lake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall be in the tomb.<br />
Some brother bard may chance to stray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ask for Ieuan E&rsquo;an?&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; But here no Ieuan&rsquo;s seen.&rdquo;</p>

Lock&rsquo;d in the tomb, his prison gray;<br />

With myriad snares for youthful feet?</p>
<p>These are before thee, while the aid<br />

A last home there&mdash;and thou behind.</p>

He knows thy lot, and well doth care<br />
For all, and for thee will prepare.</p>
<p>If through His help, Jehovah good!<br />
Thou smilest now in blissful mood;<br />
May I not think, safe in His hand<br />
Thou mayest travel through this land?</p>
<p>Smile on, my child, for thou wilt find<br />
In Him a friend and father kind;<br />
He&rsquo;ll guide the orphan on his way,<br />
Nor ever will his trust betray.</p>

We all shall meet a joyous band,<br />
Without ought danger more to part,<br />
Or tear or sigh to heave the heart.</p>

Yields an Eden of communion.</p>
<p>Poor the man that roams creation<br />
Without woman for companion,<br />
Destitute of all protection,<br />
Without her to bless his station.</p>
<p>Gentle Woman! all we covet<br />
Without thee would be but wretched,<br />
Without thy voice to banish sorrow,<br />
Or sweet help from thee to borrow.</p>
<p>Thou art light to cheer our progress,<br />
Star to brighten all our darkness,<br />
For the troubled soul an anchor<br />
On each stormy sea of terror.</p>
<h3>THE FAITHFUL MAIDEN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Rev. Daniel Evans</span>, B.D.</p>
<p>At the dawning of day on a morning in May,<br />
When the birds through the forests were skipping so gay;<br />
While crossing the churchyard of a parish remote,<br />
In a district of Cambria, whose name I don&rsquo;t note:</p>
<p>I saw a fair maiden so rich in attire,<br />
Second but to an angel her mien did appear;<br />
Quick were her footsteps in tripping the sand,<br />
And flowers resplendent were borne in her hand.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>I
fled to concealment that I might best learn<br />
Her object and wish in a place so forlorn,<br />
Without a companion&mdash;so early the hour&mdash;<br />
For a region so gloomy thus leaving her bower.</p>
<p>Anon she advanced to a new tomb that lay<br />
By the churchyard path, and there kneeling did stay,<br />
While she planted the flowers with hands so clear,<br />
And her looks were replete of meekness and fear.</p>
<p>The tears she would dry from eyelids fair<br />
With a napkin so snow-white its hue and so rare;<br />
And I heard a voice, that sadden&rsquo;d my mind,<br />
While it smote the breeze with words of this kind:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here lieth in peace and quiet the one<br />
I loved as dear as the soul of my own;<br />
But death did us part to my endless woe,<br />
Just when each to the other his hand would bestow.</p>
<p>Here resteth from turmoil, and sorrow to be,<br />
The whole that in this world was precious to me;<br />
Grow sweetly, ye flowers! and fair on his tomb,<br />
Altho&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er rival his beauty and bloom.</p>
<p>He erst received from me gifts that were more dear,<br />
My hand for a promise&mdash;and a lock of my hair,<br />
With total concurrence my portion to bear<br />
Of his weal or his woe, whether cloudy or fair.</p>
<p>While sitting beside him how great my content,<br />
In this place where my heart is evermore bent;<br />
If I should e&rsquo;er travel the wide globe around,<br />
To this as their centre my thoughts would rebound.</p>
<p>Altho&rsquo; from the earth thou dost welcome nor chide,<br />
Nor smilest as once thou didst smile on thy bride;<br />
And yet my beloved! &rsquo;tis comfort to me,<br />
To sit but a moment so near to thee.</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Thy
eyes bright and tender my mind now doth see,<br />
And remembers thy speech like the honey to me;<br />
Thy grave I&rsquo;ll embrace though the whole world beheld,<br />
That all may attest the love we once held.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE EWE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By rev. Daniel Evans</span>, B.D.</p>
<p>So artless art thou, gentle ewe!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy aspect kindles feeling;<br />
And every bosom doth bedew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each true affection stealing.</p>
<p>Thou hast no weapon of aught kind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against thy foes to combat;<br />
No horn or hoof the dog to wound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That worries thee so steadfast.</p>
<p>No, nought hast thou but feeble flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein thy only refuge;<br />
And every cur within thy sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is swifter since the deluge.</p>
<p>And when thy lambkin weak doth fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; often called to follow,<br />
Thy best protection to the frail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilt give through death or sorrow.</p>
<p>Against the ground her foot will beat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoutly pure her purpose;<br />
Full many a time the sight thus meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought tears to me in billows.</p>
<p>But if wise nature did not give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her sharp tooth or weapon,<br />
She compensation doth receive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From human aid and reason.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>She
justly has from man support<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Gainst wounds and tribulation;<br />
And has the means without distort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To yield him retribution.</p>
<p>Yea, of more value is her gift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than priceless mines of silver<br />
Or gold which from the depth they lift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through India&rsquo;s distant border.</p>
<p>To man she gives protection strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From winds and tempests howling,<br />
From pelting rain, and snow-drifts long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When storms above are beating.</p>
<p>The mantle warm o&rsquo;er us the night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the dismal shadows;<br />
What makes our hearts so free and light?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What but the sheep so precious!</p>
<p>Then let us not the Ewe forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When winter bleak doth hover;<br />
When rains descend&mdash;and we safe set&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us be grateful to her.</p>
<p>Her cloak to us is comfort great<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When by the ditch she trembles;<br />
Let us then give her the best beat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For her abode and rambles.</p>

<p>Restless wave! be still and quiet,<br />
Do not heed the wind and freshet,<br />
Nature wide is now fast sleeping,<br />
Why art thou so live and stirring?<br />
All commotion now is ending,<br />
Why not thou thy constant rolling?</p>
<p>Rest thou sea! upon thy bosom<br />
Is one from whom my thoughts are seldom,<br />
Not his lot it is to idle,<br />
But to work while he is able;<br />
Be kind to him, ocean billow!<br />
Sleep upon thy sandy pillow!</p>
<p>Wherefore should&rsquo;st thou still be swelling?<br />
Why not cease thy restless heaving?<br />
There&rsquo;s no wind to stir the bushes,<br />
And all still the mountain breezes:<br />
Be thou calm until the morning<br />
When he&rsquo;ll shelter in the offing.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Deaf art thou to my entreaty,<br />
Ocean vast! and without mercy.<br />
I will turn to Him who rules thee,<br />

Keep him from the wave&rsquo;s destruction!</p>

<p>Dry the leaf above the stubble,<br />
Soon &rsquo;twill fall into the bramble,<br />
But the mind receives a lesson<br />
From the leaf when it has fallen.</p>
<p>Once it flourished in deep verdure,<br />
Bright its aspect in the arbour,<br />
Beside myriad of companions,<br />
Once it danc&rsquo;d in gay rotations.</p>
<p>Now its bloom is gone for ever,<br />
&rsquo;Neath the morning dew doth totter,<br />
Sun or moon, or breezes balmy<br />
Can&rsquo;t restore its verdant beauty.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Short its glory! soon it faded,<br />
One day&rsquo;s joy, and then it ended;<br />
Heaven declared its task was over,<br />
It then fell, and that for ever.</p>

<p>Sad died the Maiden! and heaven only knew<br />

<p>Sad died the Maiden! beside the fast door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With her head resting low on the flagging,<br />

Bitter is the world in spirit,<br />
Deep the sea to all who fathom,<br />
Deep the world and without bottom.</p>
<p>Unsupporting in his danger<br />
Is the sea unto the sailor,<br />

Shoals and quicksands in its mazes,<br />

BARD&rsquo;S LONG-TRIED AFFECTION FOR MORFYDD.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Dafydd ap Gwilym</span>.</p>
<p>All my lifetime I have been<br />
Bard to Morfydd, &ldquo;golden mien!&rdquo;<br />
I have loved beyond belief,<br />
Many a day to love and grief<br />
For her sake have been a prey,<br />
Who has on the moon&rsquo;s array!<br />
Pledged my truth from youth will now<br />
To the girl of glossy brow.<br />
Oh, the light her features wear,<br />
Like the tortured torrent&rsquo;s glare!<br />
Oft by love bewildered quite,<br />
Have my aching feet all night<br />
Stag-like tracked the forest shade<br />
For the foam-complexioned maid,<br />
Whom with passion firm and gay<br />
I adored &rsquo;mid leaves of May!<br />
&rsquo;Mid a thousand I could tell<br />
One elastic footstep well!<br />
I could speak to one sweet maid&mdash;<br />
(Graceful figure!)&mdash;by her shade.<br />
I could recognize till death,<br />
One sweet maiden by her breath!<br />
From the nightingale could learn<br />
Where she tarries to discern;<br />
There his noblest music swells<br />
Through the portals of the dells!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>When
I am from her away,<br />
I have neither laugh nor lay!<br />
Neither soul nor sense is left,<br />
I am half of mind bereft;<br />
When she comes, with grief I part,<br />
And am altogether heart!<br />
Songs inspired, like flowing wine,<br />
Rush into this mind of mine;<br />
Sense enough again comes back<br />
To direct me in my track!<br />
Not one hour shall I be gay,<br />
Whilst my Morfydd is away!</p>
<h3>THE GROVE OF BROOM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Dafydd ap Gwilym</span>.</p>
<p>The girl of nobler loveliness<br />
Than countess decked in golden dress,<br />
No longer dares to give her plight<br />
To meet the bard at dawn or night!<br />
To the blythe moon he may not bear<br />
The maid, whose cheeks the daylight wear&mdash;<br />
She fears to answer to his call<br />
At midnight, underneath yon wall&mdash;<br />
Nor can he find a birchen bower<br />
To screen her in the morning hour;<br />
And thus the summer days are fleeting<br />
Away, without the lovers meeting!<br />
But stay! my eyes a bower behold,<br />
Where maid and poet yet may meet,<br />
Its branches are arrayed in gold,<br />
Its boughs the sight in winter greet<br />
With hues as bright, with leaves as green,<br />
As summer scatters o&rsquo;er the scene.<br />
(To lure the maiden) from that brake,<br />
For her a vesture I will make,<br />
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Bright
as the ship of glass of yore,<br />
That Merddin o&rsquo;er the ocean bore;<br />
O&rsquo;er Dyfed&rsquo;s hills there was a veil<br />
In ancient days&mdash;(so runs the tale);<br />
And such a canopy to me<br />
This court, among the woods, shall be;<br />
Where she, my heart adores, shall reign,<br />
The princess of the fair domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her, and to her poet&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
This arbour seems a paradise;<br />
Its every branch is deftly strung<br />
With twigs and foliage lithe and young,<br />
And when May comes upon the trees<br />
To paint her verdant liveries,<br />
Gold on each threadlike sprig will glow,<br />
To honour her who reigns below.<br />
Green is that arbour to behold,<br />
And on its withes thick showers of gold!<br />
Joy to the poet and the maid,<br />
Whose paradise is yonder shade!<br />
Oh! flowers of noblest splendour, these<br />
Are summer&rsquo;s frost-work on the trees!<br />
A field the lovers now possess,<br />
With saffron o&rsquo;er its verdure roll&rsquo;d,<br />
A house of passing loveliness,<br />
A fabric of Arabia&rsquo;s gold&mdash;<br />
Bright golden tissue, glorious tent,<br />
Of him who rules the firmament,<br />
With roof of various colours blent!<br />
An angel, &rsquo;mid the woods of May,<br />
Embroidered it with radiance gay&mdash;<br />
That gossamer with gold bedight&mdash;<br />
Those fires of God&mdash;those gems of light!<br />
&rsquo;Tis sweet those magic bowers to find,<br />
With the fair vineyards intertwined;<br />
Amid the wood their jewels rise,<br />
Like gleams of starlight o&rsquo;er the skies&mdash;<br />
Like golden bullion, glorious prize!<br />
How sweet the flowers which deck that floor,<br />
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>In
one unbroken glory blended&mdash;<br />
Those glittering branches hovering o&rsquo;er&mdash;<br />
Veil by an angel&rsquo;s hand extended.<br />
Oh! if my love will come, her bard<br />
Will, with his case, her footsteps guard,<br />
There, where no stranger dares to pry,<br />
Beneath yon Broom&rsquo;s green canopy!</p>

<p>Ah! birch tree, with the verdant locks,<br />
And reckless mind&mdash;long hast thou been<br />
A wand&rsquo;rer from thy native rocks;<br />
With canopy of tissue green,<br />
And stem that &rsquo;mid the sylvan scene<br />
A sceptre of the forest stood&mdash;<br />
Thou art a traitress to the wood!<br />
How oft, in May&rsquo;s short nights of old,<br />
To my love-messenger and me<br />
Thou didst a couch of leaves unfold!<br />
Thou wert a house of melody,&mdash;<br />
Proud music soared from every bough;<br />
Ah! those who loved thee sorrow now!<br />
Thy living branches teemed and rang<br />
With every song the woodlands know,<br />
And every woodland flow&rsquo;ret sprang<br />
To life&mdash;thy spreading tent below.<br />
Proud guardian of the public way,<br />
Such wert thou, while thou didst obey<br />
The counsel of my beauteous bride&mdash;<br />
And in thy native grove reside!<br />
But now thy stem is mute and dark,<br />
No more by lady&rsquo;s reverence cheered;<br />

To mark the parish market-place!<br />

Long as its hospitality<br />
The bard shall freely entertain,<br />
My birch! thy lofty stature shall remain!</p>
<h3>THE HOLLY GROVE.</h3>

<p>Sweet holly grove, that soarest<br />
A woodland fort, an armed bower!<br />
In front of all the forest<br />
Thy coral-loaded branches tower.<br />
Thou shrine of love, whose depth defies<br />
The axe&mdash;the tempest of the skies;<br />
Whose boughs in winter&rsquo;s frost display<br />
The brilliant livery of May!<br />
Grove from the precipice suspended,<br />
Like pillars of some holy fane;<br />
With notes amid thy branches blended,<br />
Like the deep organ&rsquo;s solemn strain.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>House of the birds of Paradise,<br />
Round fane impervious to the skies;<br />
On whose green roof two nights of rain<br />
May fiercely beat and beat in vain!<br />

The hardened steel as soon will blight;<br />
When every grove and hill are pathless<br />
With frosts of winter&rsquo;s lengthened night,<br />
No goat from Hafren&rsquo;s <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141">{141}</a>

From thee a scanty meal may glean!<br />

Bird of broad hand, in youth&rsquo;s proud age,<br />

Two gifts in thee, fair bird, unite<br />
To glean the fish in yonder lake,<br />
And bending o&rsquo;er yon hills thy flight<br />
A glance at earth and sea to take.<br />
Oh! &rsquo;tis a noble task to ride<br />
The billows countless as the snow;<br />
Thy long fair neck (thou thing of pride!)<br />
Thy hook to catch the fish below;<br />
Thou guardian of the fountain head,<br />
By which Syvaddon&rsquo;s waves are fed!<br />
Above the dingle&rsquo;s rugged streams,<br />
Intensely white thy raiment gleams;<br />

<p>Sweet May, ever welcome! the palace of leaves<br />
Thy hand for thy wild band of choristers weaves;<br />
Proud knight, that subduest with glory and power,<br />
Each glen into verdure, to joy every bower;<br />
That makest the wilderness laugh and rejoice,<br />
In the chains of thy love, in thy cuckoo&rsquo;s shrill voice;<br />
That fillest the heart of the lover with glee,<br />
And bringest my Morfydd&rsquo;s dear image to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! that dark Winter thy mansions should blight,<br />
With his chill mottled show&rsquo;rs, and his flickering light,<br />
His moon that gleams wanly through snows falling fast,<br />
His pale mist that floats on the wings of the blast:<br />
With the voice of each river more fearfully loud&mdash;<br />
Every torrent all foam, and the heaven all cloud!<br />
Alas! that stern Winter has power to divide<br />
Each lover from hope&mdash;from the poet his bride.</p>

<p>Hail, bird of sweet melody, heav&rsquo;n is thy home;<br />
With the tidings of summer thy bright pinions roam&mdash;<br />
The summer that thickens with foliage the glade,<br />
And lures to the woodland the poet and maid.<br />
Sweet as &ldquo;sack,&rdquo; gentle bird, is thy beautiful voice,<br />
In thy accents the lover must ever rejoice:<br />
Oh! tell me at once, in thy musical lay,<br />
Where tarries the girl whose behest I obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor bard,&rdquo; said the cuckoo, &ldquo;what anguish and
pain<br />
Hast thou stored for thyself, all thy cares are in vain,<br />
All hopes of the maid thou awaitest resign,<br />
She has wedded another, and ne&rsquo;er can be thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the tale thou hast told&rdquo;&mdash;to the cuckoo I cried,<br />
&ldquo;For thus singing to me of my beautiful bride<br />
These strains of thy malice&mdash;may winter appear<br />
And dim the sun&rsquo;s light&mdash;stay the summer&rsquo;s career;<br />
With frost all the leaves of the forest boughs fill,<br />
And wither the woods with his desolate chill,<br />
And with cold in the midst of thy own forest spray,<br />
Take thy life and thy song, foolish cuckoo, away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Too long I&rsquo;ve loved the fickle maid,<br />
My love is turned to grief and pain;<br />
In vain delusive hopes I stray&rsquo;d,<br />
Through days that ne&rsquo;er will dawn again;<br />

For her whose face my soul ador&rsquo;d<br />
My wealth I madly spent in wine,<br />
And gorgeous jewels of the mine.<br />
I deck&rsquo;d her arms with lovely chains,<br />
With bracelets wove of slender gold;<br />
I sang her charms in varied strains,<br />
Her praise to every minstrel told:<br />
The bards of distant Keri know<br />
That she is spotless as the snow.<br />
These proofs of love I hoped might bind<br />
My Morfydd to be ever true:<br />
Alas! to deep despair consign&rsquo;d,<br />
My bosom&rsquo;s blighted hopes I rue,<br />
And the base craft that gave her charms,<br />
Oh, anguish! to another&rsquo;s arms!</p>

and Abergwesyn, in Breconshire, in 1740.&nbsp; After serving for about
three years he became a convert to the Welsh Puritanism of the period,
introduced by the eloquence and piety of the Revs. Daniel Rowlands of
Llangeitho, and Howel Harris of Trevecca, both theretofore eminent ministers
of the Established Church, with whom he became a successful co-operator,
not only as an eloquent preacher, but especially as the most celebrated
Hymnist of Wales.&nbsp; This eminent man died in 1791, and his hymns
were published by his son in 1811, and Mr. Mackenzie, of Glasgow, issued
a superb edition of his works with biography in 1868.]</p>

FARMER&rsquo;S PRAYER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Rev. Rees Prichard</span>, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Translated by the Rev. William Evans</span>.</p>
<p>[Any collection of Welsh poetry that does not contain a portion of
the poems of the &ldquo;Good Vicar Prichard of Llandovery&rdquo; would
be incomplete.&nbsp; This excellent man was born at Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire,
in the year 1579, and died there in 1644.&nbsp; After a collegiate course
in Oxford he was inducted to the Vicarage of his native parish, and
received successively afterwards the appointments of Prebendary, and
Chancellor of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He composed a multitude of religious
poems and pious carols, which were universally popular among his contemporaries
and had great influence upon the Welsh of after-times.&nbsp; They were
collected and published after his death under the title of &ldquo;Canwyll
y Cymry,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Candle of the Welsh,&rdquo; of which about
twenty editions have appeared.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Welshman&rsquo;s Caudle&rdquo;
has for the last two hundred and fifty years found a place beside the
Holy Bible in the bookshelf of almost every native of the Principality,
and has been consecrated by the nation.&nbsp; It consists of pious advice
and religious exhortation suited to all conditions and circumstances
of life.&nbsp; An English translation of the poems was published by
Messrs. Longman &amp; Co., in 1815.]</p>
<p>O Thou! by whom the universe was made,<br />
Mankind&rsquo;s support, and never failing aid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who bid&rsquo;st the earth her various products bear,<br />
Who waterest the soft&rsquo;ned soil with rain,<br />
Who givest vegetation to the grain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto a peasant&rsquo;s ardent pray&rsquo;r give ear!</p>
<p>I now intend, with care, my land to dress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in its fertile womb to sow my grain;<br />
Which, if, O God! thou deignest not to bless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I never shall receive, or see again.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>In
vain it is to plant, in vain to sow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain to harrow well the levell&rsquo;d plain,<br />
If thou wilt not command the seed to grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shed thy blessing on the bury&rsquo;d grain.</p>
<p>For not a single corn will rush to birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all that I&rsquo;ve entrusted to the earth,<br />
If thou dost not enjoin the blade to spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the young shoot to full perfection bring.</p>
<p>I therefore beg thy blessing on my lands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O Lord! and on the labour of my hands,<br />
That I thereby, may as a Christian, live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my support, and maintenance receive!</p>
<p>Open the windows of the skies, and pour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy blessings on them in a genial show&rsquo;r;<br />
My corn with earth&rsquo;s prolific fatness feed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give increase to all my cover&rsquo;d seed!</p>
<p>Let not the skies, like brass in fusion, glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the earth, with heat, as hard as iron grow,<br />
Let not our pastures and our meads of hay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For our supine neglect of Thee, decay!</p>
<p>But give us in good time and measure meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A temp&rsquo;rate season, and sufficient heat,<br />
Give us the former and the latter rains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give peace and plenty to the British swains.</p>
<p>The locust and the cankerworm restrain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dew that blights and tarnishes the grain,<br />
The drought, the nipping winds, the lightning&rsquo;s glare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which to the growing corn pernicious are.</p>
<p>O, let the year be with thy goodness crown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it with all thy choicest gifts abound,<br />
Let bleating flocks each fertile valley fill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lowing herds adorn each rising hill.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Give
to the sons of men their daily bread,<br />

Give wine and oil to those that till the field,<br />

<p>Give us a harvest with profusion crown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let ev&rsquo;ry field and fold with corn abound,<br />
Let herbs each garden, fruit each orchard fill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let rocks their honey, kine their milk distill.</p>

So, on our knees, shall we thy name applaud,<br />

<p>A virtuous, cheerful, and obliging wife<br />

Better than houses, tenements and lands,<br />
Than pearls and precious stones, and golden sands.</p>
<p>She is a ship with costly wares well-stow&rsquo;d,<br />
A pearl, with virtues infinite endow&rsquo;d,<br />
A gem, beyond all value and compare:<br />

<p>My shepherd is the Lord above,<br />
Who ne&rsquo;er will suffer me to rove;<br />
In Him I&rsquo;ll trust, he is so good,<br />
He&rsquo;ll never let me want for food.</p>
<p>To pastures green and flow&rsquo;ry meads,<br />
His happy flock he gently leads,<br />
Where water in abundance flows,<br />
And where luxuriant herbage grows.</p>
<p>When o&rsquo;er my bounds I chance to roam,<br />
My shepherd finds and brings me home;<br />
And when I wander o&rsquo;er the plain,<br />
He drives me to the fold again.</p>
<p>Or should I hap to lose my way,<br />
And in death&rsquo;s gloomy valley stray,<br />
I need not ever be dismay&rsquo;d,<br />
For God himself will be my aid.</p>
<p>In whate&rsquo;er pasture I abide,<br />
He still is present at my side;<br />
His rod, his crook, his shepherd&rsquo;s staff,<br />
In every path shall keep me safe.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>My
soul with comfort overflows,<br />
In spite of all my numerous foes;<br />
And thou with richness hast, O Lord!<br />
And plenty crown&rsquo;d my crowded board.</p>
<p>His precious balms, my God hath shed,<br />
Upon my highly favoured head:<br />
And with the blessings of the Lord,<br />
My larder is completely stor&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>His bounty and his mercies past,<br />
Shall follow me unto the last;<br />
And, for his favours shown to me,<br />
His house, my home shall ever be.</p>

<h3>SHORT IS THE LIFE OF MAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By Rev. Rees Prichard</span>, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Translated by the Rev. W. Evans</span>.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s life, like any weaver&rsquo;s shuttle, flies,<br />
Or, like a tender flow&rsquo;ret, droops and dies,<br />
Or, like a race, it ends without delay,<br />
Or, like a vapour, vanishes away,</p>
<p>Or, like a candle, in each moment wastes,<br />
Or, like a packet under sail, it hastes,<br />
Or, like a courier, travels very fast,<br />
Or, like the shadow of a cloud, &rsquo;tis past.</p>
<p>Strong is our foe, but very weak the fort,<br />
Our death is certain, and our time is short;<br />
But as the hour of death&rsquo;s a secret still,<br />
Let us be ready, come He when he will.</p>

<p>Cast thou on him thy troubles all,<br />

He will not let the righteous fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever suffer them to need.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the Giver of all good;<br />
But should&rsquo;st thou trust thy wit and skill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;lt lose the prize that by thee stood.</p>
<p>Full many a man still lives in need,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; But for his servants still prepares;<br />
Whilst at our ease we sweetly doze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He daily for his household cares.</p>
<p>Say, can a mother e&rsquo;er forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her charge, her sucking babe neglect?<br />
Should even maternal fondness set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God will his servants recollect.</p>
<p>Ere thou shalt woe or want behold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (If thou dost truly God obey)<br />
He&rsquo;ll tell a fish to fetch thee gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy just expenses to defray.</p>
<p>Though, like the widow&rsquo;s meal, thy store<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be but small&mdash;yet in a trice<br />
(If thou dost strictly God adore)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll make that little store suffice.</p>

<p>God feeds the warblers of the wood,<br />

It has been conjectured that this poem referred to the tradition of
the Welsh, that the whole island had been possessed by their ancestors,
who were driven into a corner of it by their Saxon invaders.&nbsp; When

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
